00:24:43	Gabriele Whyard:	@vianee yes it’s a lot I also run a medical practice and there are only so many hours in the day lol
00:25:14	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	fabulous, I am the alchemist of possibilities :-)
00:25:25	Flavia Padilha:	@Jan is right, a slight change can make a whole difference...

00:30:37	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Fantastic! Thank you.
00:30:47	Vianee:	i cant see anything on the screen right  now?
00:30:50	Harvey Johal:	Can we still get the detailed reference materials for the build from scratch?  So we have both the pre-made prep material but also the ingredients to make the material?
00:30:54	Derek Egeberg:	I am SOOOOOO READY>...........this is going to be KILLER!!!!!!!
00:31:17	Adriana:	are we going to be able to learn in such a short time?
00:31:19	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@V there is a post on screen : Full disclousure. Make sure you’re on Tyler’s Screen (top left)
00:31:26	Lea Emery:	I got so much out of just doing the prep!
00:31:38	helena mcleod:	Wonderful - thank you.
00:31:53	Marie P.:	Yes, there is always so much yummy brain food in Sara and Tyler’s sessions. You might feel compelled to watch the recordings 5 times.
00:32:12	ileana - Host:	@Vianee make sure you’ve clicked on the ‘Tyler’s screen’ tab at the top of your Zoom screen
00:32:20	Sharon L. West:	email?
00:32:25	Amandine Russell:	Thank you  but no idea what you are saying.. but i am learning ..
00:32:29	Betsan:	That is amazing thank you
00:32:51	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank goodness we’ll have these recordings. ;)
00:32:54	Vianee:	i see a blank screen let me log off and log in again.. maybe an internet problem
00:33:04	Sharon L. West:	Well, lol I have Chat GPT opm
00:33:11	Karen Yoder:	We are getting a HUGE UP LEVEL!!!
00:33:23	Joffrey Berti:	thank you Sara, so far with the preparation didn't get what I was doing really.
00:33:30	Joffrey Berti:	I love this part of the program
00:33:33	ileana - Host:	@Sharon we sent out announcements and it was under your lesson. There were no emails sent so you didn’t miss out! (Tyler is not aware where we communicate)
00:33:35	Vianee:	now yes i can see everything.. <3
00:33:46	ileana - Host:	Great @Vianee
00:33:56	Amandine Russell:	Yes, thanks for the Replays..
00:34:55	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Automations vs Agents
00:35:12	Daniel Wang:	Great review of the definitions.
00:35:17	Jan Davidson:	We Asked to be dent EMAILS for class prep info and it was agreed!
00:35:27	Nathalia Carbajal:	LOVE this analogy. 🙂
00:36:31	ileana - Host:	@Jan as I explained before, we cannot spam you with so many emails. My understanding is that we agreed to put it in your lesson, and you agreed to look at the lesson before class. But I can bring it up again with the team to consider, of course.
00:37:05	Sherylle Bates:	This is so helpful. Thank you.
00:37:11	Alice Greene:	Not familiar with term "parameters"
00:37:12	Vianee:	i love that
00:37:16	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank you - I love this format you are sharing
00:37:21	AlphD:	MCP can also be defined as "interfaces"
00:37:24	Baxter:	So cool.
00:37:27	cherie:	some of us can only watch recording - so please if you respond to questions in the chat, can you speak to it as well?
00:37:29	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	Yeah! Great start!!!
00:37:35	Vianee:	THANK YOU
00:37:42	Andrea Martinez:	Thanks so much!!
00:38:19	May Cheung:	Eleana, I agree!  Every student should know how to access the course contents
00:38:30	Saskia:	Sounds great!
00:38:32	Harvey Johal:	@Alice - think of parameters as options.  In the context of Starbucks, think of it as : latte, American, drip coffee, etc….  A parameter is either a single selection for passing information to something or a list of items to something - could be to send it to code, or something else
00:38:32	Nathalia Carbajal:	Yummmmm
00:39:02	Tonette:	Love Hattie B's! Good chicken!
00:39:03	ileana - Host:	@May thanks for your feedback, it all helps! And the energy today is great 😄!!!
00:39:19	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	Reps?
00:39:22	Nathalia Carbajal:	What are reps?
00:39:48	Harvey Johal:	Reps = representatives
00:39:50	Catarina 108x:	Representatives?
00:39:52	Ben:	yum
00:40:09	MikeL:	Think about the gym. REPS
00:40:13	Alice Greene:	thanks Harvey
00:40:15	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Practice runs / like reps in working out in a gym
00:40:26	Daniel Wang:	Not Rep-ublicans.  ;)
00:40:33	Nathalia Carbajal:	I don’t think it’s reps like at the gym lol
00:41:00	May Cheung:	repetition
00:41:02	Brian Honeyman:	repetitions (like reps in a gym)
00:41:05	Sara:	Reps = repetition
00:41:23	WButler:	Lets go!
00:41:31	Laurie Mann:	Repo = Repository
00:41:38	cherie:	will it not work on chat got?
00:41:40	cherie:	gpt
00:41:41	Jack:	30 min intro b4 the training even starts hmmm m
00:41:46	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank you Laurie!
00:42:09	Frank Carreon:	Sara wins
00:42:22	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	🙂
00:42:27	Betsan:	EXACLTY. Love this
00:42:30	Darren Sweet:	Brilliant idea to all build same project in class!
00:42:40	Karen Yoder:	You are great teachers! Thank you for letting us practice first.
00:42:43	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Yes - Laurie!!!
00:42:49	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	Repository
00:42:50	Lea Emery:	Repo = repository
00:42:52	Jeff Holman:	repository
00:42:55	Andrea Burns:	REPO = Repository
00:42:55	Wendy Wilson:	Let's go!!!
00:43:03	Lea Emery:	(I Clauded it last night ;-)
00:43:07	AlphD:	repo +>repository
00:43:13	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Nicole a place to save everything
00:43:19	Laurie Mann:	Code Repository is where the code is stored - the infrastructure
00:43:39	Juan Antonio:	I have not been in a live class for a while, I am glad I chose today to appear with you guys!
00:43:49	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Hi Juan!!!

00:44:26	Catalina Villarreal:	Thank youl Laurie
00:44:29	Michela Gentile:	So repetitions are repetitive actions, or requests or steps?
00:44:36	Mark Ligthart:	Let's go!
00:44:50	May Cheung:	Great teachers!!!  I am actually not lost 🤣
00:45:02	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@michaela - repetitive (action) - practicing
00:45:04	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	😂
00:45:06	Nathalia Carbajal:	hahaha love that
00:45:09	Andrea Martinez:	LOL
00:45:10	Baxter:	And it’s fun
00:45:19	Conns:	Fun is allways better
00:45:25	Ryan Berkey:	absolutely easiest way to contextualize this process for sure
00:46:00	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	😂
00:46:04	Kathy Hidalgo:	me too
00:46:05	Sherylle Bates:	Love that show
00:46:06	Conns:	Im a nerd too!
00:46:08	Vianee:	hahahahah
00:46:09	Catarina 108x:	I love cinnamon!
00:46:10	Andrea Burns:	🤣

00:46:21	Steven E Jones, PhD:	Love it
00:46:24	Daniel Wang:	Love TBBT!  Cinnamon!
00:46:28	Lea Emery:	My AI s are Tardis and Firefly…. Scifi nerd here
00:46:54	Harvey Johal:	Firefly!!  Love it Lea!
00:46:59	Elena Shockman:	Sorry that was my mistake!
00:47:23	May Cheung:	drop questions on Q&A
00:47:25	MikeL:	Use the Q&A for questions....
00:47:25	Elena Shockman:	I laughed so hard that I hit the raise hand button!
00:47:42	Lea Emery:	🤣
00:47:45	ileana - Host:	@Elena no worries at all it was good to clarify that you cannot unmute ☺️
00:47:54	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Put questions in CHAT where Sara can see them and filter them/
00:49:19	Harvey Johal:	The librarian, assuming that is part of the pre-built content.  Will we have an opportunity to build our own librarians?  Or reference material for it?
00:49:59	Natalia Mikhail:	So then each agent = 1 function, not like reading customer emotion + writing appropriate response?
00:50:03	Joffrey Berti:	I came to AI Mastery FOR THIS. thank you
00:50:09	Lorena Velasquez:	What is the name of this platform?
00:50:20	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	Not yet there…
00:50:35	Joffrey Berti:	Harvey Librarian retrive the info
00:50:40	Baxter:	Holla
00:51:51	Joffrey Berti:	platefomr "you Got email"
00:51:54	Nathalia Carbajal:	Can’t only one agent do it all?
00:52:18	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	I love this personification - it make is easier to recall what each step is
00:52:33	Julian Mota:	so where is library in this sequence?
00:52:34	Derek Egeberg:	i may be jumping ahead..........will this work for SMS and PHONE also?  i'm crazy excited about this.
00:52:36	Dr. William Cole:	5 different agents...Right?
00:52:37	AlphD:	Apologies laptop crashed
00:52:41	Lea Emery:	So each agent has very specific skills, instructions, and reference knowledge to do their jobs. Is that correct?
00:52:44	Dr. Donna:	Fabulous!!
00:52:46	Baxter:	@Nathalia - specialization helps the resources focus and not get lost.
00:52:50	Khadijah Sellers:	I love this session already
00:52:57	PI:	How would the agentic team handle an issue that wasn't found in its knowledgebase or via web research?
00:52:58	Daniel Wang:	Yeah, one agent with multiple personality disorder....
00:53:14	Lisa's Notetaker (Otter.ai):	Lisa is on a Basic Otter plan with 30 minute meetings. To record longer meetings, upgrade to Pro: https://otter.ai/pricing?utm_source=oa-chat-basic
00:53:14	Nathalia Carbajal:	Thanks, Baxter. But it would be good to understand deeply why...
00:53:14	David Boshears:	@Nathalia… think about the custom instructions you use to set up a project or custom GPT… that’s what’s needed for these agents.  Now try to imagine crafting *one* set of custom instructions to cover all of these scenarios and not get you, or the agent, confused
00:53:16	Laurie Mann:	LOL
00:53:29	Baxter:	And as each agent matures (via self learning and edits) it can refine on one specific thing.
00:53:30	Laurie Mann:	@Daniel!
00:53:32	Harvey Johal:	Thanks Joffrey - not what I was asking.  Was asking for material on how librarian was built
00:53:36	Gabriele Whyard:	@danielwang lol that’s funny
00:53:44	Nathalia Carbajal:	Thnanks @David! 🙂 That makes more sense
00:54:06	David Boshears:	Just like with a human team, it works better to use a “division of labor” strategy
00:54:12	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Nathalia - also if something isn’t working… it’s easier to pinpoint the place to fix
00:54:25	Karen Yoder:	LAYERS!!
00:54:35	Nathalia Carbajal:	Thank you! ❤️
00:54:40	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@karen - exactly what I was thinking :)
00:54:48	Michael Wilson:	Agents are like building blocks in a business workflow
00:55:01	AlphD:	Onions have layers🤓
00:55:09	Alesia Myers:	is that a technology limitation that will be improved in the future?
00:55:28	Dr RaShon:	Refer to Domenic’s lessons on layers
00:55:43	Ray:	Supervisor
00:55:49	Harvey Johal:	Boss Agent = orchestration
00:56:06	Lea Emery:	It’s also easier to troubleshoot when something goes wrong.
00:56:11	Joffrey Berti:	WhatsApp instead of Slack ?
00:56:18	Joffrey Berti:	thanks Tyler
00:56:31	May Cheung:	Please put questions on the Q&A
00:56:40	Shawn Shapiro:	how do you deploy these agents to your customers?
00:56:58	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@May - we have been asked to write them in the CHAT.
00:57:37	Juan Guillermo Echeverri:	This is a process of the company. Or a workflow?
00:58:01	May Cheung:	If you want your questions answered, put on Q&A
00:58:12	May Cheung:	Your questions will get lost on this chat
00:58:47	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Beautiful!
00:58:57	Betsan:	It's a no-brainer to have several agents, and to have them ping Slack for a double-check to keep it human. It just makes workflows more efficient. Just had to type that out to get it stuck in my mind-blown brain. Love it.
00:58:59	Drina Bascón:	To make better the impact of all of them do you build an extra agent of each one of them or Haller and Bishop have this function for all the process?
00:59:01	Lea Emery:	We also need to let them get to the workshop… the sand is running through the hourglass
00:59:17	helena mcleod:	very interesting. So human  is involved. Very good. It makes sense to have that to prevent Ai risk.
01:00:00	Rupal Sheth:	Can we build a recon tool like a bank recon ?
01:00:00	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	yes
01:00:04	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	yes
01:00:06	*Dietrich Busacker:	n8n  could be replaced by make?
01:00:06	Gwen Mitchell:	Can you make larger
01:00:08	Nicole Wilke:	TOO SMALL
01:00:12	helena mcleod:	do the AI generated emails come into your main inbox or into a separate email inbox?
01:00:16	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	Too small
01:00:25	Rupal Sheth:	Cant see
01:00:33	Kamion:	Awesome idea Rupal
01:00:42	Marie P.:	You can also zoom in
01:00:43	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank you
01:00:44	Barbara Platteel:	better!
01:00:56	Rupal Sheth:	@kamion - we can do it together
01:01:00	ileana - Host:	Remember you can also always use the Zoom function by clicking the three dots next to ‘Tyler’s Screen’
01:01:01	May Cheung:	Helena, question in the q&A
01:01:02	Jeanne:	Can you set this up  with Apple Mail? or just gmail?
01:01:17	May Cheung:	Jeanne, put question in Q& A
01:01:48	Michela Gentile:	We see the slide
01:04:12	Vianee:	@harvey @joff might need your help later on this.
01:04:22	David Boshears:	@Jeanne - Apple Mail is just the generic IMAP trigger/node
01:04:37	Harvey Johal:	@Vianee 👍
01:04:40	Wendy Wilson:	Can we have a copy of this workflow?
01:04:43	Barbara Platteel:	woaw so cool!!!!!
01:04:50	Carey:	looks good.
01:04:57	Nathalia Carbajal:	🤯🥰
01:04:59	Kathy Hidalgo:	its a good flow following fine
01:05:03	Jeanne:	t
01:05:05	Laurie Mann:	wowsa
01:05:06	Jeanne:	Thank you
01:05:10	Sherylle Bates:	AWESOME!!!!!!
01:05:11	Harvey Johal:	Noooooo waaaayyyy
01:05:13	Karen Yoder:	OMG>>>THANK YOU!!!!
01:05:14	Dayleen:	Excellent!!
01:05:17	Joffrey Berti:	WOW
01:05:21	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Can claude build it without VS Code?
01:05:23	Joffrey Berti:	yihooooooooo
01:05:28	Wendy Wilson:	wow
01:05:30	Gabriele Whyard:	@Jeanne I have been asking that question and never got an answer
01:05:31	Ozzie Stewart:	Makes  sense, looking forward to using this, though nervous
01:05:32	Mariana Small:	That’s going to be a game changer!
01:05:33	David Boshears:	@Wendy… we’re going to built it - he’s just giving us the overview
01:05:34	Joffrey Berti:	@Danika. VS CODE VS CODE lol
01:05:38	Marie P.:	We are not even in 8D yet! 😂
01:05:44	Alesia Myers:	I was just thinking if you are able to share this copy
01:05:57	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@J Jajajaja
01:06:04	Betsan:	Unbelievable. 😀
01:06:06	Joffrey Berti:	@D chichi
01:06:17	Wendy Wilson:	@David thanks.
01:06:18	AlphD:	Vibe Agentic💪🏽
01:06:21	Kathy Hidalgo:	is set up next?
01:06:31	Gabriele Whyard:	@david- does that mean it can be set up for apple mail?
01:07:00	Julian Mota:	are there more than 2 passes for this review of emails?  or is it a loop?
01:07:02	David Boshears:	@Gabiele - yes, just need to change gmail to IMAP nodes configured to Apple Mail
01:07:11	Eloise Mathieu:	@Joffrey are you taunting @Danika?
01:07:38	Tonette:	Can it be used if the business used Microsoft?
01:07:49	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@E yes he is - with Chichis!
01:08:18	Eloise Mathieu:	@danika, it is impressive.  And here I thought this was only N8N
01:08:49	Vivianne Rozsa:	What’s RAG again?
01:09:06	Jo McCracken:	These are great explanations!  Start high level, then get into details.  Perfect teaching you two!
01:09:06	Nathalia Carbajal:	Where is the knowledge stored for the agent to access it?
01:09:10	AlphD:	Vector store???
01:09:13	Gabriele Whyard:	@david- I don’t use gmail at all only mac mail is I need to set up a gmail first?
01:09:16	May Cheung:	RAG - retrieval augmented generation - create a knowledge base
01:09:33	Marie P.:	Haha, yes. Always!
01:09:35	Sherylle Bates:	That’s ok. I’m here. All in.
01:09:39	Karen Yoder:	TY
01:09:39	eWaste Direct:	you guys are so cool
01:09:45	Conns:	this is priority 1
01:09:50	Eloise Mathieu:	All IN
01:09:53	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank you
01:09:56	David Boshears:	@Gabriele - for this course?  I would… as instructed in the pre-session set up
01:09:56	Betsan:	👍🏼
01:10:52	AlphD:	Vector store was skipped🧐
01:10:59	Laurie Mann:	Retrieval Augmented Generation - it's the process of evolving knowledge in the model as it retrieves relevant information from sources and then it generates an answer using the new information
01:11:40	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Laurie - TY!
01:12:31	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	nice!
01:12:45	Laurie Mann:	Vector Store is a specialized database designed to store and search embeddings (numerical representations of similar text, images, audio, etc.) Its for easy search. Like tagging data for easy retrieval
01:13:03	Harvey Johal:	https://www.cassidyai.com/
01:13:07	Andrea Martinez:	Thanks @Laurie
01:13:13	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	cost only input - not output
01:13:16	Gabriele Whyard:	@david - thank you.  I was just wondering if it is possible.
01:13:26	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	So instead of Pinecone we’ll use Google Gemini??
01:14:16	Baxter:	If Cassidy is a replacement for Pinecone then you get more for the price.
01:14:23	Joffrey Berti:	Sara and Tyler, LOVE your teaching style. Grateful to be here tonight
01:14:51	Joffrey Berti:	@D yes Gemini files
01:15:15	Sara:	Thank you @joffrey - we bring VIBES to teaching AI ;-)
01:15:19	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Baxter - is it really called Cassidy - or did Sara and Tyler just name her that? - like CinnaMon, Hatch, etc.
01:15:28	Gwen Mitchell:	Should our documents be covered to MD for faster processing?
01:15:29	Khadijah Sellers:	Vector Store
01:15:31	helena mcleod:	Do you keep/store files in Word and in say Google doc and Airtable? or do you stick to one platform and keep one platform as the library?  I don't know currently how i wouldn't use Word.
01:15:36	Joffrey Berti:	will we run this too ?
01:15:47	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@J 🙏🏽
01:16:00	Marie P.:	@danika https://www.cassidyai.com/
01:16:30	Lea Emery:	Thank you, Sara! ❤️
01:16:34	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	We know you are thank you
01:16:37	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Thank you all
01:16:50	Miguel Florit:	I'm a one person business. If I adopt any of this I simply won't make any money because I'll be spending all my time building workflows with imaginary employees. So is this not really a very clever non-salesy pitch to outsource this stuff to you? Frankly, I've got more chance of scaling Mt Everest barefoot in a pair of shorts! So, I definitely walked into the wrong room here! [Very well presented though guys!]
01:17:26	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Miguel 💗😅
01:17:51	S J singh:	We need to get N8N membership ? Or any other platform like Claude as well can do this job ?
01:17:55	Darren Sweet:	@Miguel once you build a system, it will keep doing that portion of your work, forever
01:18:07	Baxter:	@Miguel I think because they are taking time to explain it seems overwhelming and time consuming, but after a couple of reps, you’ll be flying through this and that’s where the real value is.
01:18:15	Tonette:	My business uses Microsoft for email
01:18:19	AlphD:	@ Miguel if you build it once then that's good for a long time
01:18:29	Gabriele Whyard:	@miguel lol I feel the same
01:18:50	Tonette:	Can you use this for Microsoft instead of Gmail?
01:18:59	Laurie Mann:	Miguel, these are tool options if they fit the needs.  I don't drive my corvette to the grocery store or pick up the Christmas tree
01:19:04	Lea Emery:	AI developing AI
01:19:31	DionGeBorde:	@Miguel, having been a solopreneur for years myself, I've bumped up against the glass ceiling of doing it all myself. This allows you to "hire" help at the cheapest possible rate, but instead of training people, you're training AI.
01:19:36	David Boshears:	@Tonette - you can change the mail nodes to Outlook, IMAP… whatever is needed, but for the course you should use a Gmail account to learn it.  Then you can change things, build new things, as needed
01:19:40	iPhone:	It works just with gmail or also outlook
01:20:02	☆KAVSTAR☆:	Sweet!
01:20:06	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Can we not just talk directly to Claude instead of talking to Claude through VS Code ?
01:20:28	kavita:	thank you for the explanation.. i work better if i understand the logic a little at least
01:20:29	Sharon L. West:	It’s helpful way explaining!  I trust the process 🙂
01:20:30	Tonette:	@david boshears thanks
01:20:33	Karen Yoder:	This is AMAZING!!! Stay in learning space.
01:20:33	Sherylle Bates:	This is great. I appreciate the context.
01:20:40	David Andruss:	Yes. This is the general overview. Just priming our brains for learning more detail later.
01:20:42	Isabelle Mickelson:	Yes!
01:20:43	Julian Mota:	wait what is TOAST?
01:20:44	MikeL:	keep going..... this is great
01:20:49	Greg Giles:	Keep going this is amazing
01:20:54	Lea Emery:	This is great for me… your prep work helped, this is also so relevant to my position at my organization.
01:21:04	May Cheung:	Sara and Tyler are great teachers!!!
01:21:05	David Boshears:	@Danika - Claude, Claude Code, and Claude Code via VS Code are all very different experiences
01:21:11	Sharon L. West:	have no idea about preview setup 🙁
01:21:13	Raj:	Along with the templates will we get the prompts used to build the infrastructure/agents/workflow?
01:21:23	Andrea Martinez:	Awesome! I’ll be watching this class over again for sure.
01:21:24	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@David - thank you.
01:21:28	Daniel Wang:	Clearly you can teach.  So far so great!
01:21:28	Darren Sweet:	TOAST = Totally Overwhelmed and Sucking Tequila?
01:21:40	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@darren! LOL
01:21:41	Andrea Martinez:	LMAO
01:21:41	Claudia Bres:	🤣
01:21:43	Lea Emery:	The prep was in Six, on our Lesson page, in the Community Announcements...
01:21:44	Isabelle Mickelson:	lol
01:21:46	Joffrey Berti:	Darren LOOOL
01:22:03	Jo McCracken:	🤣
01:22:11	Pamela:	Im not a tech person - but this is awesome.  You guys are doing a great job teaching this content.  My favorite session yet.
01:22:23	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	x2
01:22:26	Sara:	Thank you @may - we say to our students we are here for the mindset not just the tactical learning, because it requires growing in both
01:22:27	Vianee:	ile do you think we can have extra classes with tyler and sara? like 2 more sessions ? kind like a bonus sessions so things flows smoothly
01:22:28	Lea Emery:	Great analogy
01:22:30	Vianee:	for us
01:22:33	Eloise Mathieu:	@Darren  Precious !±
01:22:44	Kamion:	And eventually we got beer.
01:22:44	May Cheung:	Toast - Improvement methodology, recursive loop
01:22:55	Angelica:	I love that analogy!!
01:22:58	David Boshears:	@Danika - I put a nice article about the value of Claude Code in the SIX chat. Check it out if you haven’t seen it.  Additionally, Claude Code is a CLI/termiinal experience… using it via VS Code gives you a GUI UX for a more comfortable user experience
01:22:59	May Cheung:	Love love love the names 🤣
01:23:09	Laurie Mann:	😅
01:23:12	Julian Mota:	OK  i'm good with both method approaches
01:23:15	Lea Emery:	I have to say that this prep work was the best yet.
01:23:21	Baxter:	So the last time I meta prompt it cost me all my crypto 🤣
01:23:34	Vianee:	deep
01:23:38	Dr. William Cole:	All you guys lost... No Problem!   Just Review the recording and do this...   All those Completely Lost... Review the recording twice and do...!!!
01:23:43	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	YES - VS Code was the most challenging for me.
01:24:08	May Cheung:	trust the process, and watch the replay 10x 🤣
01:24:13	☆KAVSTAR☆:	Love it! Thank you
01:24:14	Karen Yoder:	YAY! Upgrade xoxo
01:24:16	Ana Cristina de la Torre:	Rewiring!!!
01:24:17	Lea Emery:	Yes, the set up was a challenge, took me a lot of time (more than the estimated 90 minutes 😆)
01:24:24	Laurie Mann:	worth it already!
01:24:25	*Dietrich Busacker:	Howlong will the Setuo process take us an ni techs?
01:24:25	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	If anything, think of these insights as a blueprint for outsourcing with precision.

Once you understand the methodology, you can hand it to an assistant or contractor and have them execute it step-by-step. That frees you to operate at the level where you create the vision, direct the flow, and manifest outcomes — not get trapped in tactical work.

If we’re the ones doing the tactical execution, we’re under-utilizing our true value. I know this all too well — unfortunately, and humorously, from experience.
01:24:30	May Cheung:	Sara, let’s go!  So far so good
01:24:31	Juan Guillermo Echeverri:	Confusion is accelerated learning. No worries.
01:24:31	Sharon L. West:	@ MC LOL smh
01:24:33	Joffrey Berti:	I LOVE VS CODE now.
01:24:45	Joffrey Berti:	(I wanted to kill it first)
01:24:45	Daniel Wang:	I'll take a swig of that Patron and trusting the Process.
01:24:59	cherie:	so chatgpt … a wasted investment?
01:25:06	May Cheung:	Getting ready to get confused 🤣
01:25:13	Darren Sweet:	@Joffrey yes I love to watch it do my work with Claude!
01:25:24	Sara:	You all have a great growth mindset!!! Proud of you all!!
01:25:41	Michela Gentile:	Where do we find VS code?
01:25:56	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	remember, input the trascript of this session to NotebookLM and watch it slow down to your rate that you need it to flow :-)
01:25:57	Joffrey Berti:	@michela follow what Ile posted in the Lesson, step by step
01:26:07	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	or self host on proxmox :-)
01:26:21	Michela Gentile:	Ok. Thanks
01:26:35	Linda Tetsmann:	Thank you for the impressive and inspiring lesson. Now I have to leave, but know I am excited to catch up 🙂
01:26:36	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	They just upgraded mine from 14 days to 30 day free trial
01:26:40	Harvey Johal:	@ Michela - the links and instructions to the setup are in today’s lesson: https://home.mindvalley.com/quests/en/ai-mastery-2025/days/32
01:26:41	Sara:	brb
01:26:42	Laurie Mann:	VS = Visual Studio; Microsoft's open source code editor
01:26:51	Steve Finegan:	Can we have a self-hosted N8N instance in the cloud? I am assuming yes.
01:27:05	Gwen Mitchell:	Q.  So you guys use Cassidy over N8N or both?
01:27:26	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Gwen you need both
01:27:38	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	yes
01:27:39	Joffrey Berti:	yes
01:27:40	Laurie Mann:	yes
01:27:40	Andrea Martinez:	YES
01:27:40	Wendy Wilson:	yes
01:27:41	Isabelle Mickelson:	yes
01:27:45	David Boshears:	“Too many windows”… siempre lol
01:27:48	Lea Emery:	VS Code… tiny tiny
01:27:49	Claudia Bres:	Too small!!
01:28:01	Panda:	what is the link for the REPO?
01:28:44	Joffrey Berti:	Claude is because it's better to code right?
01:28:46	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	claude code indeed the best!
01:29:06	Christine:	when you install what should you sign in with- if you have an ms account and a gmail account?
01:29:27	Joffrey Berti:	Nothing Christine, just put on our laptop
01:29:34	Catalina Villarreal:	yes...
01:30:11	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	lol;
01:30:16	cherie:	but after your first month, would you lose everything that you built?  if you didn’t continue to pay?
01:30:19	AlphD:	You can resize your windows. Drag your mouse between the video and drag to the right
01:30:20	Saskia:	Claud Pro?
01:30:54	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Cherie - you will lose it… but you cna download it first…and then make similar in Make.com or Zapier if you choose
01:31:12	eWaste Direct:	sorry what site is this?
01:31:30	Mark Ligthart:	Tyler works with Claude via OpenRouter?
01:31:31	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	This is an APP you download to your computer: VS Code
01:31:38	Robert Shapiro:	We need to be subscribed to both ChatGPT and Claude?
01:31:43	Melissa Turner:	Claude code for VS and what was the other one?
01:31:50	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Either one will work
01:31:50	Laurie Mann:	We are in Visual Studio and we are opening Claude within it.
01:32:19	Harvey Johal:	Codex - Open AI’s coding aghent
01:32:22	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	super wisper I think now works on all!
01:32:33	AlphD:	For zoom in on the PC/Laptop click on the 3 dots and select the magnification for your personal screen
01:32:45	Lea Emery:	I use Ito for same thing…. Covered in other classes.  Thanks, Tyler!
01:33:11	Tyler:	https://github.com/8Dvibes/mindvalley-ai-mastery-students
01:33:14	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	Sara/Tyler - as  you teach - ask chatgpt - for the equivalent for Windows/Android - so that you can reach the other 90% of the population who uses those systems :-)
01:33:25	Conns:	Wispr Flow for PC works well
01:33:26	Marie P.:	Ito is too good! I switch from Macwhisper that was always very buggy.
01:33:50	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	https://superwhisper.com/windows
01:33:54	Angelica:	Wispr Flow has been great!
01:33:57	Joffrey Berti:	Conns I can use Wispr Flow on PC too ???
01:34:10	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Sara - GitHub told me to download to my Mac. Is this necessary?
01:34:14	Joffrey Berti:	or is the one from @alberto ?
01:34:35	Michael Wilson:	Totally lost
01:34:37	Conns:	YEs Joffery, it works in PC.
01:34:45	Joffrey Berti:	yipee thanky
01:34:46	MikeL:	what is the equivalent item we need to add for the codex/gpt option?
01:34:47	Ozzie Stewart:	Sorry I have to leave to return......I'll miss so much
01:34:49	Barbara Platteel:	lost
01:34:57	Joffrey Berti:	@D am sure you'll install everything now right?
01:35:08	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@J LOL
01:35:09	Lea Emery:	You will have to follow the prompts in the prep materials.
01:35:10	Barbara Platteel:	can you show WHERE you go after an installation and /or before
01:35:26	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Yep - thank you!
01:35:27	Claudia Bres:	Thank you!!!
01:35:35	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	for Android - Dictate is Epic!  Truly amazing!  Do read the 3 page documentation - as it can do so much!  Android only

01:36:04	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@ Sara - Will Loom video be made available today?🙏🏽
01:36:30	Darren Sweet:	Yes pls so much to do!
01:36:50	Joffrey Berti:	to everyone, during our installation just follow the steps and do what it asks to do. scary but trust the process
01:37:12	Michael Wilson:	Where are installation steps laid out?
01:37:16	kavita:	so i missed.. whoich dication ap[p[ is Tylar us9ing. itried ito but it gets stuck a lot
01:37:24	Sara:	Right on @joffrey - it looks intimidating but if you follow the process you will be fine
01:37:26	Lea Emery:	It took a moment to recognize when Claude Code’s display was checking materials/instructions and when it wanted me to read and take action (aside from the BASH/ etc dialog boxes)
01:37:26	Laurie Mann:	wow
01:37:30	Nathalia Carbajal:	It was SO FUN to do the prep work and talk with Claude Code to get things set up 🙂
01:37:39	Joffrey Berti:	Agreed for Claude code agent , but when I installed this afternoon I freaked out it's doing so much thing I Don't understand lol
01:37:47	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Kavita - he is using Whsprflow… but there is also Ito - recommended by Vyk
01:37:54	Andrea Martinez:	Wow!

01:39:49	Andrea Martinez:	WOW!!
01:40:08	Eloise Mathieu:	Is it normal we get different results; I don’t see the directory and content for example.
01:40:14	Wendy Wilson:	This is great, Tyler!
01:40:28	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	Claude is truly incredible. Im fascinated with its capacity. It is really helping me with everything
01:40:30	Andrea Martinez:	WHAT?! It’ll do the setup too!
01:40:37	Karen Yoder:	What does “test bridge round trip mean”?
01:40:56	Joffrey Berti:	@Sara, Claude Code use our claude credit or Nothing to do ? because it can run fast
01:40:59	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	WOW
01:41:11	cherie:	do you need whisper if chat got lets you speak to it?
01:41:18	Harvey Johal:	Sara/Tyler. -  Claude Code requires a minimum Pro account on Claude.  Can you confirm?  It didn’t work with the free version until I upgraded to the paid version
01:41:21	WButler:	wow
01:41:23	Adriana:	i have so many questions !!
01:41:34	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	Claude does not let you speak directly
01:41:37	Gwen Mitchell:	@Alberto would you be replacing slack with dart?
01:41:43	cherie:	ah!  thanks 🙂
01:41:43	kavita:	loooove it!
01:41:45	PI:	Could this agentic workflow be adapted to onboard subcontractors?
01:41:53	Laurie Mann:	wow
01:41:56	Sara:	@pi
01:42:12	Marie P.:	@Harvey you can also use their API and only pay for credits as needed.
01:42:13	Sara:	Yes, you can create any kind of workflow once you know what to do @PI
01:42:19	Sherylle Bates:	What’s a vector store?
01:42:19	Joffrey Berti:	Claude Code created a new folder, and move the Repo to a new one for me as it told me it's better architecture on my pc !
01:42:27	Daniel Wang:	Anthropic (Creator of Claude) is looking at an IPO with valuation estimated at $300B apparently.  Now I can see why.
01:42:40	Joffrey Berti:	WOW
01:42:43	Laurie Mann:	Yes, onboarding subcontractors takes days - week(s)
01:43:13	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	I'd invest in claude/Antrhopic in an instant!  truly a class of its own!
01:43:19	Joffrey Berti:	I didn't understand why we did a C Desktop, now I do
01:43:38	Sharon L. West:	so sad.. (not so much me- the situation) in such a bad way for all of this— (and others) getting message desktop hard drive failing and laptop almost totally out of space smh  If not for extension for learning… all MV  investments would be complete burns smh—
01:44:01	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	Yes, Claude is best in class
01:44:03	Wendy Wilson:	Even I, as a beginner, understands what Tyler is saying.  I am excited to go over the replay (and the Loom that will be sent to us) and start building it. Yikes, scary and exciting at the same time!  🔥
01:44:24	May Cheung:	Wendy, 10000% agree!
01:44:29	Sherylle Bates:	@Wendy me too. This been easy to follow.
01:44:45	Joffrey Berti:	how do you make them talk to each other ?or not at all not sure to understand when do use what sorry
01:44:46	Andrea Martinez:	Same, the more I’m listening I’m understanding.
01:44:49	Harvey Johal:	@sharon - move stuff to Google Drive or something else?  Would that help?  Could be an opportunity to go buy some new tech.....
01:45:03	Darren Sweet:	Yup very clear and still moves fast, but this is just the high level. Next we have to do it all lol
01:45:21	Joffrey Berti:	Step 3 is setting up the Claude Desktop.
01:45:21	Andrea Martinez:	lol
01:45:34	Joffrey Berti:	OMG
01:45:37	Andrea Martinez:	I can be lazy too.
01:45:39	May Cheung:	Reminder - If you want Sara and Tyler to answer your questions, please put in Q&A
01:45:54	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	What you guys are teaching us today is the best use of AI with everything orchestrated. Thank you
01:45:55	Gwen Mitchell:	How do credits work on Claude Code or do you need a subscription
01:45:55	Camilla Bignell - Streamline Your Business:	This is incredible and looking forward to the replay and loom! Thanks so much to you both Sara & Tyler!
01:46:07	Audrey Kohli:	Could you explain how uploading file on Claude desktop (semantic) is different from Claude VS
01:46:13	Jo McCracken:	I love how Tyler says thank you to AI.  I do that, too!  Just a human habit.
01:46:15	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	I happily pay $100 a month for claude - but their $20 a months will do!
01:46:16	Andrea Martinez:	Good to know.
01:46:32	Joffrey Berti:	Agreeeed 20$ for so much
01:46:40	yasamin bahadorzadeh:	yes. I use claude code all the time, and I have paid subscription, but I run out of credits all teh time. Is there a way we can be efficient in teh way we ask questions or prompt it?
01:46:45	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	No. Not from Claude - but from Anthropic
01:46:53	cherie:	but then it’s junked after you don’t continue for the next month?
01:46:55	Joffrey Berti:	thanks for this answer Tyle. about the bucket of credit
01:47:14	Joffrey Berti:	ROI
01:47:40	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	But don’t we need credit added to our Anthroipc account?
01:47:45	Laurie Mann:	Semantic Search: Search that is beyond keyword matching and searches based upon semantics of the search query inserted. A regular search only looks at the exact words to search whereas Semantic Search may return documents because it understands the meaning or context of what I'm looking for
01:47:47	May Cheung:	Thanks Tyler!
01:47:50	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	@yasamin: I use Chat GPT to write the prompts for Claude and I optimized the back and forth 100%+
01:48:03	cherie:	yes - what’s the ROI on buying all of these tools if we are doing something simple - can we put that in friday’s session?
01:48:06	Frank Carreon:	Can Claude code vibe code apps for us like lovable
01:48:13	Gwen Mitchell:	Does claude code get your closer to production ready or more for prototyping ?
01:49:29	Hazel Mindvalley Team:	💡 Just a quick reminder that you can always rewatch the recording at your own pace. Feel free to pause, take notes, and revisit any part as many times as you like. You’ll get even more clarity each time you go through it. You’ve got this!💪
01:49:29	Wendy Shears:	What is Github
01:49:36	Lea Emery:	Oh!!!!!!!!!
01:49:41	Joffrey Berti:	so we discuss with each C D et Claude Code separatly right?
01:50:08	Eloise Mathieu:	You have files on the left sidebar of your Visual Studio Code . How did you get the files there?
01:50:08	Glenn Tjon:	You guys are doing great!
01:50:21	Flavia Padilha:	GitHub was not part of the prework, do we need an account?
01:50:22	Rupal Sheth:	how long will the session be ?
01:50:34	Marie P.:	In the 8D, time is not the same. Lol Every hour is more like 90 minutes. 😄
01:50:37	Joffrey Berti:	same Flavia, the GitHub we missed it ?
01:50:40	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Will we be receiving the Loom video today so we have time to work on it before Friday’s Class?
01:50:45	Sara:	@marie knows lol
01:50:56	Sara:	@danika yes
01:51:10	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
01:51:38	Laurie Mann:	GitHub is a platform for hosting software development projects that allows storage of code, tracks changes, allows team collaboration, integrate automation for building and deploying software. The big feature is version control of code.
01:51:42	Khadijah Sellers:	We were not instructed to do anything in GITHUB in the instructions before class. Did I miss something?
01:52:01	Joffrey Berti:	not clear what we do with C Desk vs Claude Code. We Always start and ask question to C Desk right?
01:52:30	Joffrey Berti:	I ask because Tyler speaks only to C Code
01:52:39	May Cheung:	So cool!
01:52:46	Laurie Mann:	GitHub is integrated in Visual Studio
01:52:47	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Khaddijah - I believe it was listed in one version of the Prep work shared with us. When I installed VS Code - it included GitHub in the process.
01:53:18	Joffrey Berti:	actualy all, Claude C asked me to instal GitHub, so yes it's installed during the process. Just say YES
01:53:22	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	btw, check out twinmind, where you can ask questions agaist the what we are listenting to, and catch us up - pretty amazing!
01:53:46	Joffrey Berti:	Wait it speaks with Ileana voice ?
01:53:52	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	lOl
01:54:02	May Cheung:	🤣
01:54:04	Laurie Mann:	You can create different environments by defining them. For example, you can create a Test environment and a Production environment with the claude code.
01:54:04	Lea Emery:	@joffrey 🤣
01:54:08	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	example

ased on the session with Tyler and Sara, the connection to GitHub is managed for you by an AI assistant called Claude Code right within the VS Code application. You don't have to handle the GitHub connection manually. Here is the step-by-step process they described:

Install VS Code: First, you'll need the free application called VS Code (Visual Studio Code) installed on your computer.

Install the Claude Code Extension: Inside VS Code, you'll go to the "Extensions" marketplace and search for "Claude Code" from the company Anthropic. You'll install this extension.

Log In: Once installed, Claude Code will ask you to log in to your Claude account. This links the assistant to your account.

Talk to Claude Code: You will then interact with Claude Code through a chat interface directly within VS Code. You'll tell it that you want to get set up for the workshop.

Clone the Repository: You will provide the GitHub repository link (the project files) to Claude Code and ask it to "clone" it. Cloning is just t
01:54:47	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	The magic here, as Tyler explained, is that you are acting as an orchestrator. You tell the AI assistant what you want (to download the project from GitHub), and it figures out how to do it for you.

Don't worry if it feels a bit overwhelming! Tyler and Sara mentioned several times that they will be sending out a detailed Loom video and step-by-step written instructions to walk you through this exact setup process. You'll be able to follow along at your own pace.
01:54:51	May Cheung:	“All done” 🤣
01:55:01	Laurie Mann:	that's fantastic!
01:55:20	Karen Yoder:	Claude code and claud desktop
01:55:21	Joffrey Berti:	I Don't understand the copy paste in between the both Claude….
01:55:38	Barbara Platteel:	off but where IS the project? I didn’t see it in the instructions
01:55:47	Joffrey Berti:	thanks Sara <3
01:56:03	May Cheung:	@Alberto Thanks for the notes! 🙏
01:56:07	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	BTW a supe powerful add on for claude is BMAD!  - Opensource on Github!
https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD
01:56:10	Ales:	Cant we use Claude code directly in the Claude app?
01:56:11	Karen Yoder:	Explains he “why” of each claud..what do the do
01:56:20	Lea Emery:	What is amazing is that it walks through it for you. Tell it when it doesn’t work, give it screen shots if you can’t find what it’s telling you… I did that and we trouble-shooter together.
01:56:22	Sherylle Bates:	Is this like a human in the loop example to make sure its set up right?
01:56:30	Harvey Johal:	I think because Claude CLI takes 15mins to install?  Guessing
01:56:40	Khadijah Sellers:	Okay, I could not figure out how to install Claude Code or VS Code. Now I know why I missed GITHUB. Thank you.
01:57:05	Isabelle Renaud:	Do you need to do this for every project or just one?
01:57:09	Joffrey Berti:	they talk to each other alone ???
01:57:22	Joffrey Berti:	then we go for a coffee and come back ?
01:57:26	Laurie Mann:	We are setting up the infrastructure right now.
01:57:43	ileana - Host:	I’ll share the form link at the end of the call 🙂!
01:57:43	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	this session with Sara and Tyler is worth listenting to 3 or 4 times - one gem after the other!  Fabulous!!!
01:57:49	Joffrey Berti:	agreed @alberto . GOLD
01:57:51	Craig:	How much free space should be available on your computer?
01:57:58	MikeL:	Do you need the bridge if your just using chatGPT
01:58:07	Isabelle Renaud:	I was waiting for it
01:58:15	Joffrey Berti:	chatGPT feels like a Dinausor age seriously
01:58:25	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	Their Vibe, frequency is widly high!   Kudos to Sara and Tyler -
01:58:27	Sherylle Bates:	Don’t rush. This is great.
01:58:27	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	But if we aren’t building such advanced systems / workflows, perhaps just Claude (not Code) can do the job well.
01:58:37	eWaste Direct:	so sorry, can you recap on getting claude code set up in VS code?
01:58:46	David Andruss:	So glad we’ll have this entire lesson recorded. My brain is exploding! Thanks so much, Sara and Tyler! This is so helpful. Looking forward to the Loom video and the extra materials to help me get through this setup tomorrow.
01:58:49	Sara:	Ty @alberto - we bring vibes!
01:58:57	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@J don’t you dare speak about Chica that way. lol
01:59:13	Jason White:	@Joffrey - i was thinking the same thing!
01:59:16	Cheryl:	This is fantastic-thanks Tyler & Sara
01:59:19	Joffrey Berti:	ah yes sorry. Dinosauress. it's a girl
01:59:24	Derek Egeberg:	i am excited and ready to go 0-100 MPH fast.  Want to build this to answer calls, emails, SMS and also convers with customers to take applications, request documents and do follow-up.  You're showing me i can more than likely connect this to my database/crm and trigger conversations based on databpoints.  Am I correct in that thought?
01:59:25	Alesia Myers:	written step-by-step instructions along with Loom video would be so useful!
01:59:31	Raj:	+1 to @Craig's question. what PC system requirements (RAM, SSD etc.) do you need ?
01:59:36	Khadijah Sellers:	You guys are amazing
01:59:36	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	I’m loving this and looking forward to the Loom and rewatching this video. Thank you Sara and Tyler - you are great teachers
01:59:37	Isabelle Mickelson:	Do we need to do this setup for each project?
01:59:56	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	👆🏽
02:00:09	Joffrey Berti:	How do you commit ?
02:00:21	Drina Bascón:	How often?
02:00:33	May Cheung:	@derek me too! 🤩
02:00:37	Andrea Martinez:	Does the cloud mean Google Drive or whatever? Will y’all recommend a cloud service
02:01:02	Rui:	In app building it’s a good practice to commit every time you add a small functionality
02:01:09	Andrea Martinez:	Cool. So, Github is the cloud?
02:01:16	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	Here is what twinmind is sharing about BMAD-METHOD

hat's a fantastic question, Alberto! It gets right to the heart of what makes this workshop so unique. Based on everything Tyler and Sara have been explaining, that specific GitHub repository is the "secret sauce" that powers this entire process.

Here’s why it's so powerful and absolutely worth installing:

It Contains the Pre-Built Infrastructure: Tyler and Sara have spent a significant amount of time building the entire underlying architecture for the customer service agent department. This repository contains all of that complex, pre-built work—the agent designs, the workflow logic, and the "connective tissue" that makes them all work together. By installing it, you're essentially getting a fully designed factory, and now you just need to turn it on and tell it what to do.
02:01:21	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	It's the "Cookbook" for Your AI Assistant: The repository includes all the instructions, documentation, and methodology that your AI assistant, Claude Code, will read and use to build the system for you. It's not just code; it's a set of recipes and blueprints that teaches the AI how to execute this very specific, advanced task. This is what allows you to become an "orchestrator" rather than an "executor."
02:01:27	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	It Enables the "AI Builds AI" Magic: This is the key that unlocks the whole process. Without this repository, you would have to instruct Claude Code on every single tiny step, which would be incredibly difficult. With this, you're giving the AI a comprehensive "project brief" that it can understand and act upon, handling the complex setup, file management, and connections on your behalf.
02:01:34	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	It's a Reusable Blueprint: As Tyler mentioned, once you go through this process, the entire built-out project serves as a "system level shot prompt example." This means you'll have a complete, working blueprint that you can use as a starting point to create other agentic systems for your own business or other projects in the future.
02:01:58	Andrea Martinez:	I’m going to be on YouTube to watch GitHub videos. They have their own channel.
02:02:22	Joffrey Berti:	did we open a GitHyub during the process ? this is where I am lost. will repla
02:02:32	Hazel Mindvalley Team:	💡If anything feels fast today, no worries. You can always go back to the recording, pause, and rewatch the parts you want to understand more deeply. Every repeat helps things click even more.
02:02:48	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	awesome!
02:02:53	Laurie Mann:	GitHub has a cloud version and a desktop version. The different types have different permissions and access capabilities for developer teams
02:02:58	Dr. William Cole:	All the Techies that are now lost... Welcome to My World!!! ;)Drinking From the Firw Hose...!
02:03:01	Andrea Martinez:	Both of you are amazing. Thank you sooo much
02:03:09	Harvey Johal:	Awesome; great intro and walkthrough
02:03:16	Patricia:	Looking forward to the loom videos.
02:03:57	Baxter:	Does this foundational agent takes on different personalities to become the specific individual agents?
02:04:15	Laurie Mann:	yes
02:04:45	Laurie Mann:	@baxter - my yes, is not answer to your question
02:04:47	Tyler:	Promise y’all this initial setup is always the hardest part if you can hang in there with us once the workshop is setup you’ll move with speed and grace ;)
02:05:03	Panda:	I tried to download the GitHub REPO on my computer and Claude kept giving me this error message: Error: Claude Code on Windows requires git-bas. If installed but not in PATH, set environment variable pointing to your bash.exe, similar to:
02:05:17	May Cheung:	Tyler - you are an amazing teacher
02:05:25	Laurie Mann:	LOL!
02:05:27	Baxter:	@Laurie 👍
02:05:37	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@thank you for the affirmation Tyler
02:05:38	Elena Shockman:	Yes amazing job!
02:05:38	Eloise Mathieu:	@Tyler Loved your way of teaching  !
02:05:39	Panda:	sorry not the REPO, the GitHub extension
02:05:49	Tyler:	Thank y’all so much!  This is so much fun and we are grateful for y’all giving us your time and your brains
02:05:50	Sherylle Bates:	This is great. I understood a lot as you were going through it. And I’m a beginner.
02:05:54	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	@Sara/Tyler  what do you think of Obsidian as the repository for all our knowledge base - and or what are you recommending to hold all of it?
02:05:54	Panda:	I tried to download the GitHub extension on my computer and Claude kept giving me this error message: Error: Claude Code on Windows requires git-bas. If installed but not in PATH, set environment variable pointing to your bash.exe, similar to:
02:05:58	Adriana:	I’m just worried about replicating this for another projects .
02:06:18	Angelica:	Will we learn how to build out those documents themselves? I don’t have that yet for my business
02:07:03	Lea Emery:	“Giving an Assistant degrees of agency” That lands!
02:07:19	Adriana:	@Angelica i was wondering the same thing
02:07:35	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Adriana - I think it will be much easier moving forward onto other automations and agents workflows. And n8n also has pre-built templates you can customize for your own needs.
02:07:46	Trina Latshaw:	@Panda - I had gotten error messages, too, so I asked Claude how to resolve them, and it told me how, step by step.
02:07:52	Eloise Mathieu:	@tyler, is there a reason I don’t have the documents you had in your stack on the left under explorer?  Do I need to import them .  Were those from the original file?
02:07:58	ileana - Host:	Thank you @Marie for coming in!
02:07:58	Tyler:	@panda we can help troubleshoot here in just a bit to get you across the finish line.  Ask Claude Code to research online and determine what tools or scripts it needs to setup or install on your computer (have it determine what kind of system you’re on too) and then come back to you with the game plan to fix the bug.  If you hit shift + tab while in Claude Code it will toggle between plan mode, edit mode, always ask mode.  Do that to get it into plan mode that forces it to come up with the gameplay before it does anything next.
02:08:34	Panda:	@Tyler thank you I will try to troubleshoot while she is talking lol
02:08:54	Tyler:	Ha Claude is the best helper ;)
02:09:23	Panda:	👍
02:10:14	Alesia Myers:	for those who do not have customer service at this scale, what are other real life cases this could be used for?
02:10:43	Tyler:	This could be used to simply answer your emails period. You could set this up for yourself personally ;) One of many examples
02:12:08	Flavia Padilha:	@Tyler, you recommend that we do the same case study on our end before trying to do it for our own business or case study, right?
02:12:16	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Alesia - with n8n you can create lead magnets, email newsletters, as a coach, you can send out intake forms, pre-session forms, thank you emails, updates, etc… you can also automate sm content…. All of this is helpful (even for a solopreneur) - we’re just a little in the deep end to start off  ;)
02:12:35	Raj:	@Tyler so if we want to use/replicate this CS infrastructure for our own biz we just as Claude to substitute all the needed info specifc to our biz?
02:12:51	Jennifer Brown:	If you wanted it to answer your emails - could you use your whole Gmail account as the database or "Stacks"
02:13:01	Tyler:	Yes, I’d suggest building for Hattie B’s because you’ll get the rep building a really advanced system with “training wheels” on.  And beyond that then you can start building all sorts of stuff.  Once this clicks it’s addictive lol
02:13:40	Tyler:	Raj, that’s correct.  You can have it even go look up your business and research you and come back well informed with the types of ways you would want to modify the system for your use.
02:13:43	Conns:	love it!
02:14:13	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Yes Tyler! Some of us may be swimming in the ocean to start - but that makes our kiddie pools so much easier. 😄
02:14:17	Vil:	Could you get it to go through ALL your emails and give you suggested FAQ’s based on emails on customer complaints/questions and the common responses and how we replied?
02:14:20	Raj:	Excellent - Thanks!!
02:14:34	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	this session and subsequent sessions with Ssara and Tyler make the value of AI mastery 10x :-)
02:14:52	Tyler:	Vil 100% it would take some more setup, but we’ve done that for folks in the past.  You’d want to do that systematically to do that analysis
02:16:02	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	I feel GPT knows me better for this step - me, my brand voice.
02:16:15	Sandra Salem:	Dr. frankestein: IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE!
02:16:25	Eloise Mathieu:	@sandra hahahahah
02:16:35	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	👹
02:16:53	Sherylle Bates:	@sandra 😂
02:17:46	Joffrey Berti:	LOL
02:18:18	Joffrey Berti:	will you share the voice prompt Tyle used ? 'like go and find" etc. If not it's in the transcirpt it's ok
02:19:23	Joffrey Berti:	Claude or Claude Code ?
02:20:02	Alesia Myers:	once this is built, can it be replicated for multiple businesses?
02:20:44	angela:	Sad I have to leave. Will have to watch video later. Hopefully before Friday! 🙏🏼
02:21:05	ileana - Host:	Thanks for joining @Angela!
02:21:42	Joffrey Berti:	i think my brain just switched off I feel like a headless chicken at the moment. but thank you LOVED IT
02:21:48	Laurie Mann:	@Alesia - yes, that is how most software evolves. There is a core product or a start of one and changes are made to make other products.
02:22:07	Sara:	Haha #sorrynotsorry joffrey
02:22:12	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	🐔
02:22:13	Baxter:	I must master this.
02:22:38	May Cheung:	me too
02:22:48	Joffrey Berti:	LOL @Sara. still love it. replay is our best friend (appart from Claude Code)
02:23:22	Panda:	we did some execution with Nick
02:24:02	Dr. William Cole:	I think that was the Marie Antoinette Execution... No?
02:24:23	Eloise Mathieu:	@ Dr Will 🤪
02:24:28	Karen Yoder:	Are we building Echo..or is that supplied in homework?
02:25:21	Sara:	I’m amazed at you all!! Almost 300 of you 🦾still here following #growthmindset
02:25:34	Sara:	@karen echo is supplied
02:25:46	Karen Yoder:	@Sara TY!
02:26:16	Hazel Mindvalley Team:	@Sara YES YES!!!!🎊
02:26:18	Alberto Voli Voli - Puerto Rico:	@sara - glued to the screen, lol !
02:26:33	Sara:	Haha @alberto!
02:26:35	Alesia Myers:	@Laurie wouldn't it be more efficient to use this pre-built system and just modify it to our own? Instead of rebuilding the whole one
02:26:37	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Sara - You, Tyler and this CommUNITY make it all bearable and sometimes even exciting! 😄
02:27:08	MikeL:	So we need a sonnet account for this to work?
02:27:26	Laurie Mann:	@Alesia, yes, that is an option as well
02:27:33	IreneSF:	For AI, what do you recommend is a secure repository that can store customer info etc. When we use Claude, Github how secure are they? I heard OpenAI scraped a lot of off of GitHub to build out ChatGPT
02:27:38	Laurie Mann:	Different software starts and evolves differently
02:28:30	Nathalia Carbajal:	Will we receive the steps for the Echo workflow in the homework?
02:28:42	Eloise Mathieu:	@sara … not going anywhere, until the brain cells can follow
02:29:04	Joffrey Berti:	do we have to do the Echo as Homework ? rigt?
02:29:51	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	Elucidating, Spelunking…Stewing…. 😄
02:29:51	Iva:	Whole This is absolutely impossible
02:30:02	Joffrey Berti:	@D . Drinking
02:30:05	Laurie Mann:	@Alesia - It depends upon what you are building. While you won't have to go through the onboarding process again, sometimes its easier to start a new project from scratch. Other times it's easier to copy a project and evolve it into a new product. It really depends upon how much time you have, what tools you have, etc.
02:30:10	Lea Emery:	Such great tips, Tyler! Thank you!
02:30:51	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	This is amazing! Yet not possible to go through this entire process in 1 day and have all the questions ready for the QA on Friday
02:31:19	Joffrey Berti:	the thing is, AI looks like the boss and I look like the intern
02:31:28	İbrahim BARRY:	i am blown up by not understanding how it works 😀
02:31:30	Karen Yoder:	We are so well supported❤️ This community, Tyler, Sara and now agents. Feeling loved🙂
02:31:47	Sara:	❤️‍🔥
02:32:33	Sara:	It’s normal to feel excited, overwhelmed, a little scared, empowered … this is a new way of working and your brain is being stretched 🧠
02:32:49	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	This is literally the reason why I joined this Mastery. To learn how to use Agentic AI. Thank you!
02:32:56	Joffrey Berti:	yeah i feel the stretch LOL
02:32:57	Sara:	It’s a process too so be gentle on yourselves … take a deep breath, trust yourself that you can do this,
02:32:57	Frank Carreon:	Tyler thank you so much for all this, this is what I needed and wanted you are dropping so many gold nuggets thank you
02:33:07	Barbara Platteel:	🧠 f r i e d  but looking forward to go over the steps
02:33:29	May Cheung:	I am excited to get Claude to build n8n for me!
02:33:30	Joffrey Berti:	it's really amazing. so grateful for the quality of all of this. thanks
02:34:02	Nathalia Carbajal:	Tyler says “please”. Love it! 😇
02:34:37	Daniel Wang:	Greatest thing today is showing us what is possible.  Mind blown!
02:34:48	May Cheung:	Literally speaking everything into existence!
02:35:08	Giselle Fiumara - ETHERNAL:	In my opinion, the best class we had so far. This knowledge is priceless
02:35:08	Danika ~ Enteleki Coaching Inc:	@Sara - and we have a great community to help each other as we learn and grow. Thank you and Tyler for this great teaching.
02:35:11	Andrea Burns:	I've already started referring to "YOLO" mode as "Leroy Jenkins" mode 🤣
02:35:22	May Cheung:	@Giselle agree
02:35:25	Joffrey Berti:	I feel like Tyle is teaching us to pilot the A380 and then gives us the command. LOL
02:35:30	Sara:	@Daniel that is actually the one word Tyler and I wanted to represent what we stood for, to give everyone the feeling of what’s “Possible” for them
02:35:57	Sara:	@may … lLITERALLY!
02:36:15	May Cheung:	getting Ai to build Ai to build Ai 🤣

02:36:48	Hazel Mindvalley Team:	Reading all the happy comments, this is Amazing!!! 🥰🎊
02:37:19	Gl:	Does this UIDs work on iPad?

02:38:10	Nizar Noorani:	U mentioned you would also share how to build the stacks website?
02:38:25	Sara:	@joffrey this is what we mean by the “8th dimension” 👾
02:38:31	anavonsimson:	Thank you so much! Will continue with the recording; can’t stay longer!!
02:38:50	Sherylle Bates:	Just to confirm, should the hw be completed by Fri or Wed?

02:39:36	Dayleen:	Truly amazing
02:39:38	Eloise Mathieu:	@sara, now I understand why you skipped a few dimensions 🤪
02:39:39	IreneSF:	I think we need more than Fri to get this done. It is taking ya’ll 3 hrs to explain. When will I have the time to actually get this done if I have to relisten to 3 hrs of this lesson?
02:39:53	Dr. William Cole:	WHATS THE HOMEWORK???
02:39:53	Nizar Noorani:	U guys have an amazing job with this much technical information 👏
