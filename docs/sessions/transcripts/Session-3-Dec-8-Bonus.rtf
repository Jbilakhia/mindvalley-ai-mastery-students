Transcript:\
 \
Them: Though. So we have one of our concierges, who, as you can see, we don't know why she's in the webinar and not backstage. So I'm just trying to. That's why. You see somebody called Hazel there.  \
Me: That's. Right. Okay, cool. Nice. Why'd you have a good weekend?  \
Them: I did. And you.  \
Me: Oh, yeah. I started snowing here this weekend, so it's starting to feel a little more Christmassy.  \
Them: Wow. Oh, my God, that's so different. It's so hot here. It's like 30 degrees.  \
Me: Oh, wow.  \
Them: So we definitely don't have a white Christmas. But it's nice and it's hot.  \
Me: Yeah, for sure. Let's see. Here. Okay? There's that.  \
Them: Hello, sarah. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. Someone was typing furiously. I was like, is it Tyler? Eliana? No, we have Hazel, who's. Well, it's. Actually. We don't know why she doesn't have backstage, so she's in the webinar for some reason. All done. But anyways, I'll move her. I'll move her to attendee once the webinar starts. Yeah. All right. I see 83 people already here waiting, so if it's okay with you guys, we can get started. Has anything changed, or are we still doing a guided walkthrough of part two? No, no. We're doing office hours. So this was the extra bonus session to make sure that everybody from week one.  \
Me: To. Make sure that.  \
Them: Is where they need to be. And then on Wednesday, we start week two. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we're not doing any walkthrough of any part of the homework.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Sorry.  \
Me: We might do that. We have a lot of the questions came through and we've got those answered and pushed back. And then we have some things to give to them to make sure that everyone has their week one stuff done and checked off.  \
Them: Perfect.  \
Me: They don't have it, like, perfect by the end of the day today. Or this session. Rather, they should be able to do it even after the session. So before Wednesday.  \
Them: So it's like week one stuff. Exactly. Yeah. Okay, perfect. All right, well, as usual, I'll step into the webinar and then just join me whenever. Whenever you guys are ready.  \
Me: Join. Me. Cool. Sounds good.  \
Them: Shika. Thank you so much for joining. Okay, Maybe you can get rid of Dominic's. Yeah, it's his notetakers. Yeah. Fresh in from the weekend. I'm not used to this, but I'm loving it. So I trust you all since it is Monday. Hello says Dr. Rashan. As usual, first in the chat. Nice to see you. Me guys is Sheila Anna. Hi guys. Happy happy Monday. Thank you so much for coming in. As I was saying.  \
Me: So. I post your. Monday. Hello. As I. Was saying.  \
Them: It's so nice to see you guys fresh off from the weekend, and I hope that means that you are all well rested and ready to focus in for today's bonus session. I know many of you have been working really hard on the homework, so I'm so happy that we get to come together. All done and walk through step by step. And essentially today's to make sure that everybody is fully prepared and set up for success before we step into officially into week.  \
Me: It's so nice. To see them. Again. And I hope. To. Focus. It for today. Working. Really hard. So I'm so happy that we get to come. Together. Essentially today to make sure that. Everybody is. Stuck for success this performance. Step into waiting.  \
Them: Two. And to do that, we are very lucky to have Sarah and Tyler back with us. And I definitely don't want to take up any more of the time. As you know, every single minute is packed with information. So I will just say thank you so much to both of you for putting today together and a big, big welcome. How was your weekend?  \
Me: That we. Have. With us. And we definitely don't want to take. Up any more of the time. I. Give up every single. Day. Thank you so much. To both of you. For putting together. How was your. Weekend. There we go. Interwebinar there. We go.  \
Them: Hi, everyone. Ileana, I hope you don't mind that I jumped. Jumped into the morning. Progress. Perfect. Perfect. I was just welcoming you. So welcome. I was saying thank you so much for putting this together and I hope you guys are doing great and had a wonderful weekend.  \
Me: Thank you so much. For putting this together. I hope. You guys have? Been great.  \
Them: Thank you. Thank you so much for. We're excited to be back here with you. Bonus Sara and Tyler time, guys. Excited. And also, let me know. I mean, you're not supposed to really have a restful weekend. How was your homework?  \
Me: You're. Not supposed to bring in kind of. The rest.  \
Them: How did you guys do? Did you work hard? Awesome. Well, we can see from the Google sheet that you guys were working on your homework, so we're pretty proud of you, I have to say. Like I keep saying to Tyler, you guys have got such a growth mindset. Really proud of you all.  \
Me: Of the ty. Ler.  \
Them: Because this is like, stretching your mind in different ways. And, yeah, I just want to acknowledge that right at the beginning again, because it is. It is, like, a lot to navigate. Right? Like, it's a new way of thinking, and you're looking at new things. You're navigating new things. So we're here to help you get stuck today.  \
Me: You're looking. At these things.  \
Them: Because we're going to start the second part of the homework. On Wednesday. So today's session is just to make sure that everybody is set up in part one of the homework that's done, part two of the homework that's complete and helping you get unstuck on anything. So, Tyler, is there anything that you wanted to share on that?  \
Me: Just to make sure. Every. Body. Want. Ed to. Yeah, that's right. So it's awesome. Hope all of you all had an awesome weekend. We have gotten all the questions from the weekend, which is great. And we found that there were a few blockers in there that we saw. So we can talk through those here in a minute. And in fact, even this morning, we pushed an update into the repo, and we have some other prompts to give, and we'll go through the questions and stuff here in a minute. But just like on Friday session, if you all have any questions at all, be sure to either chuck them into the Q and A or to the chat like now. Because just like on Friday, we can go ahead. And bring folks up on stage if we need to. And also I saw someone asked about the part two of the Loom. So again, in case you didn't see that or missed it on Friday, we are waiting on the Innate in support team to fix our cloud account so that we can get unblocked in showing the end to end demo of it. So as soon as that's done. I've even messaged them again this morning telling them, hey, look, we're in the middle of teaching this thing, and we kind of need it fixed. As soon as that is done, we're going to be recording that loom and sending it through. So that's not something that should would affect you all. And this stuff actually working on your end, it just blocks us from being able to record it and show that video. So hopefully that makes sense. So first things first, I'm going to put this into the chat here. This is a prompt. Number one, this is into the Zoom Chat. If everyone takes this and drops it into their Claude code and run that, what it's going to do is if you have not yet cloned down or pulled down the repository from the student repo. It will do that. And if you already have done it, it will go insure that you have the latest information. Pulled down to update it, so. Yes, and it has been updated. All right, so that's the first thing that we want to do here. And while we're waiting on that, I'm just going to work through my checklist here. We had an email or. I'm sorry, a question come through from Demetria, I believe, is correct. And was asking about slack. And Demetria must be a high D on the disk profile because they're working ahead in the homework, which is amazing. And also they were asking about an invite to our AI build lab. Slack for that. And so, just for a point of clarity, so we can make sense of this for everyone, you will need a Slack account for week two. It can be a totally free Slack account. That's no problem. But that's where the Holler agent, the agent that comes in and checks in with you wants an email comes. Through and the other agents have already looked at it, written it, and it's bringing it to you like an executive assistant, basically, that it does that in Slack. So if you don't have a slack account yet, please just go sign up for a free one and then we'll walk through that more on Wednesday on how to go get that set up and how to hauler agent will be working in there. But just wanted to call that out there, too, because Demetri asked that question. All right, y'all.  \
Them: Tyler I think people are asking just one person's ask, but I think a lot of people will be wondering this. Are we opening a new chat or is it the same chat for the prompt that you just put in the, in the.  \
Me: Yeah, great question here. So let's screen share.  \
Them: Chat.  \
Me: And you're just going to open it into a brand new chat is what you're going to do. So I'll open this up. And the stack is in there as well also, so we had questions about that. Let me. Put this in here. All of that's been pushed and updated. We had this done last week, and what happened is that it got committed, but it did not get pushed all of the way. So it got pushed into, like a commit to go to the public student. Forward facing thing that you all could see, but it got hung in like a pending folder basically before it went ahead and shipped it all the way is kind of the best way to explain that. So I'm here in vs code. And I am in Claude code. I just opened a brand new tab here. And so you can do that by just clicking on this little icon up here in the upper right hand corner. That'll open up a Claude code. Thread. And then I'm going to paste in that prompt. That I put into the chat. And then what we're going to do. Let me add this other part in. Hey, Claude. I'm just doing this. As like a demo. So you can go and check, but don't actually necessarily go and pull down and overwrite any of the things that I have in my dev repo right here. If you do want to do this to go ahead and execute on it, just pull it down into a completely fresh new folder on my desktop, please, and label it as such so that I'll know, because I'm doing this. During the Monday live demo in class. Thank you. All right. Just doing that so it doesn't. Claude, doesn't get confused here and trying to do this in the existing repository that I'm open right now. All right. And so what should be happening? Is, it's going to go and look right now. On the GitHub repo that is the public facing one for you all, and it's going to ask you to run these bash commands here. To basically go do that and then see if you have it already on your computer. And if not. It will pull that down. If you do, it will pull it down and merge it and update it into the version that you've been working in already. So you don't lose your work or anything like that. This is basically like when you're working on a real project, when Sara and I and our team work on projects and we use Claude code. When we're multiplayering. And so she might be working on some things, and I'm working on something, and someone else could be working on something else.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: We're all able to work asynchronously of each other. Push it back up into what are called branches. So, like, streams that come back into GitHub and then we can end up merging them back together and then pull down so we can basically all work separately. Push all of our work up to the cloud and then be able to determine what needs to be synced into the main and then pulled back down for everyone. So hopefully that makes sense. So now, as you can see, it's done this setup for me. It's pulled this down, and it tells me where it's located it on my computer. And so this would have everything. It even tells me what files have been added in here. So when we did this last week, like I said, it committed, but it didn't push them. So basically it put it in a commit to get the knowledge base manager information which has got the stacks built in there. The Echo V2 version of the workflow, so there's two different ones of that. Like two different parts of it now on the V2. All of that. It did not get pushed all the way up, so you all didn't have a way of accessing it. And that was a goof on RN because, like, language matters, right? And when I told it to commit, I forgot to tell it to commit and push, and that's what happened there. So I apologize for that, y'all. Let's see here. All right, so let me stop my screen share, and we'll come back over here for questions. I see.  \
Them: Like read out a couple of questions that are related as well.  \
Me: Yes.  \
Them: To help now. Like my cloth code had me setting up the echo trigger and the processor workflow. But these workflows are not complete, which is what we're doing. I understand. I have to use the voice analysis workflow instead. What are the trigger and processor workflows for? Do we still need them?  \
Me: So let's go talk to this really quickly. So bear. With me one second. Let me get my nan launched up so I'm not having to share all of my messy screen here. Okay, so, librarian. And then one. I saw your hand up there, too. We will definitely come to you here in a second and pull you up on stage so you can ask questions. I want to be sure that we can show this off first. All right. So let's go here. And. Close that. There we get. All right, cool. So let me share again. All right. Y'all. So I am in my browser now, and I'm in N8N. And if we come over here and I look in my personal section, which is probably where yours would be easiest to see on your N8N workflows, once they get pulled in, there's going to be two different parts of the echo workflow now. There's going to be a trigger. And the reason that we did these updates is a couple fold. This kind of separates the form, like captured part of getting your information for your Mega Doc that the Echo workflow is going to be looking at as the input. So that's what's happening in this first one. Once you get this set up and installed, you're going to click on this. And then click on the production URL right here. So I am, like, just so I'm not moving too fast again. You're going to be in one that's like the Echo Trigger fast response. Or it might be labeled, like, Echo Trigger, part one. Something along those lines. There's just going to be four nodes in it. That's how you know you're in the right one. You're going to click on this first one that says echo form. You're going to. And then that launches this screen. We're going to go to the production URL and copy this. And you're just going to look different than mine, too, because ours has AI BuildLab app. Like that's our cloud version of Innate N. So we're going to get that. I'm going to go ahead and open a new window and paste this in. And now you get this screen. So this is where you're going to put in your email. You're going to select personal for your voice type. Enter in your name. You don't have to put in a company name or company materials. Those are here. So that if you want to use this again after the class. You can do the same process for a company, brand, voice, or a combined company and Persona or personal Persona at the same time. But for right now, we're just doing personal. You're in your writing samples. This is where you're going to take your mega doc that you put together, which is going to have examples of your writing. Could be email, could be transcripts from calls, social posts, et cetera. If it is going to be a transcript, please make sure that at least your speaking parts are labeled so that the echo agents are able to delineate between when is it you talking versus someone else? It's pretty smart. It could probably figure it out. But let's try and make the Echo agents job a little bit easier there. If we do that, and then once you have all this added in, you're just going to hit submit. And then what happens on the back end is if we come back over here, that's going to take all your form submissions, capture them immediately, respond with, like, a window that's going to pop up and say, hey, you've submitted this. Give it about 10 to 15 minutes and you're going to get an email sent to you with a couple of different documents. One of them is going to be your brand voice. Analyses all into a doc, and another one is going. Or it might be markdown file, actually. And then the other one is going to be your XML snippet, which is like the part of your system prompt. That you're going to go add into your sugar agent to personalize it so it sounds much more like you. And then the next step is it's just going to then execute this next workflow. So let's go look at that one now.  \
Them: Tyler, while we're doing that, can I just pause? Because there's people who are confused about where we're at because this doesn't look familiar about Echo. Okay. I didn't wanted to just.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: Like, mentally just pause what Tyler was doing, because I just want to make sure that everybody is on the same wavelength, so. Because there's a whole bunch of people where this doesn't look familiar because they've completed the onboarding. That was part one of the homework we need to do onboarded for you to be able to do this. This is part of part two of the homework, which is where we are going to be utilizing. Now that you're onboarded, you have access to these things, you are going to be using the echo workflow. Which is what Tyler is showing here. To create a brand voice analysis. That you can use then, to personalize the agent's sugar agent. The sugar agent is the main agent that is going to be the expert. Kind of like, you know, your AI Version, I guess. That is. That is supposed to be the ad version of you that's working for Haddie Bees customer service. Okay? So we need this agent to sound like you, which is why we're doing this. Echo workflow. And we also need to give this agent information, which is going to be the part two of part two. And when we have that wrapped up, then on Wednesday, we're going to put together the other team members that are part of the customer service workflow. So I just wanted to make sure that everybody knows what's happening in the order of things as we're going through this. Does everybody following me.  \
Me: What's. Happening.  \
Them: Like, just put a thumbs up or. Or just ask another question because we don't want to go into the weeds. Unless you're, like, feeling you have clarity around the process. Okay, great. Okay, great. Thank you.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Looks like Dietrich might still have some questions there. I saw that. And Darren does, too. So if you also have questions or need clarity, please drop your questions in here into the chat or into the qa. Looks like Tatiana. When you say issues with setup, do you mean that you're having issues getting to Claude Code and VS code and getting all that set up. If you can. Any of you, all that have your blockers are stuck at some point, just drop them into the Q and A so that we can address those and make sure we get everyone over the hurdles here.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: All right.  \
Me: All right.  \
Them: So I have to pause because there was a lot of, like. Like, confusion in the chat. I just wanted to call that out.  \
Me: Yeah, no worries. So what we're going to do now, I'll just continue on this just for a second, so we can see how this kind of plays together. So that first echo workflow, again, is where you're providing your communication style examples to give to this echo workflow. This is the part two here. So this is the big one that's actually doing all of the work. And the reason that we updated it from the V1 to the V2 is because this can take some time to run. And also depending on your level of innate in account, it could time out on you. And so we ended up splitting this into two different things so we don't have that issue and it even emails it to you now. So basically, right here, this entry point is coming from that first one that we just saw in the four step workflow, from the one I just walked through. And it passes all that information in here. It determines on if you are doing personal, company, or combined. And then from there it's going and doing each of these different individualized brand voice analyses of you to write that, and then merge them all together into a file. And then this step right here is where it is writing that system prompt snippet that we're going to use to go and personalize our sugar agent once all of that is done. And then it's going to, like, once that's done, it passes the quality check. It's basically then going to send you an email in here. So.  \
Them: Can you clarify why their echo workflow would look different to what they're seeing here? There's a lot of questions about that.  \
Me: Yeah, it could be because of you all might have pulled down the V1, and we pushed the V2 version this morning. So if you don't have that yet, I'll go grab the prompt again, but I'm going to put this prompt back into the Zoom chat. Be sure that you run this prompt. And that might clear up a lot of this for you all. And you'll see that there is a new this V2 version that got hung up in the commit but didn't get pushed all the way live basically into the student repo. So when you pull that down and have Claude code, look at this. It should then update to your local GitHub, so your local version of everything, and then you'll have this flow and the other flows there. So then yours will look what you're saying look like what you're seeing on my screen now. And then if it's not too. Because sometimes when you first import them, they might be a little bit messy. There is a little sweep looking button down here on N8N in the bottom left hand corner. If you click on that. It depends, right? Like, it's going to clean it up. I personally like the look that it had before this, so I'm just going to back out, not save it. I like it when it's stacked. All right. There we go. All right, cool. All right, so that is the process to get the echo flow done. Once you have both of these set up, installed and then working, and you can ask Claude, it should walk you through that process. And if it doesn't ask you to help it to get these set up in your N8N and working. That's when you're going to go to the part one of it and run that workflow with your information. That will generate and send you back an email. With your brand voice analyses, which are going to want to hold on to that. And another file that's going to have your. System prompt snippet for your brand voice that we're going to use in Sugar, and we'll go cover that here a little bit later on. So let me stop my share here so I can come back and see everybody. All right.  \
Them: There's still a lot of, like, confuse, I guess, questions about the echo. Workflow. I feel like maybe we should make sure that we clear that up for everybody.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: Okay. Irene said. Where is Echo in our setup list? Not seeing it.  \
Me: Yes. So if you have already been able to successfully run the Echo workflow on the v1 version, and you have all of your analyses and your XML brand voice snippet.  \
Them: Just.  \
Me: Then you're good. You don't necessarily have to run it again. If you have not run it yet, you would want to make sure that you do the git pull that with that prompt that I just gave in there. That'll pull down the newer version that makes that process easier for everyone. And then you're going to run that workflow. So hopefully that makes sense. So you all don't necessarily have to double up on your work there. It's just in case.  \
Them: Daran, I hope that answers your question. You don't need to, like, double up or redo. It's just like. Yeah, you're good. If you. If you've run out before.  \
Me: Yeah. And Katarina is like, I'm looking at her messages that they've pasted back in here, I'm assuming from Claude code. So it's saying, does it want to put it as a new project? Does it want to add this to the existing repository or add the course materials? So if you get. A prompt back like this from Claude code, and it's asking you, do you want to pull this down as a completely new repo, or updating it or whichever way you'd like to do it. You want it to be synced in with your original, like, whichever one you already have done. So if you have already pulled it down and been working in there, just tell Claude in plain language. Say like, hey, Tyler and Sara pushed a new update and I need to make sure that all of this is pulled down and synced with my local repo here and all of it is merged together and it will take care of the rest of it for you. Cool.  \
Them: Design Studio said Echo Processor workflow is making direct calls to the Anthropics API endpoints and not allowing open router. It says I'll have to modify the workflow to use it. Ideas.  \
Me: Yeah. That's an easy fix in here, so let's do that. And again, this is a. Claude can do this, but I'll show you and explain why it's doing this. So if we go into the echo workflow, It is looking right here in these to go and do these calls to an anthropic endpoint right here. What it's going to need to do because some people might have an anthropic API key. And we advise you all to all get set up on open router. So if you tell cloud code that you have open router, you want to still use the exact same anthropic model, but run it through your open router API key instead. And provide it that information, it will come in and update your workflow to use your Open Router key. So it's a bit confusing because Anthropic also has an API key and they are like the manufacturer of the model, right? Open Router is like the Airbnb of all of the different API keys for lots of different models, so we can still run anthropic through there, and that's what we're going to be doing. So if you tell your Claude like what we were saying on Friday session that hey, I've set up open router. If you can get it all the way set up and then tell me where to go and place my open router API credential. I will do that. And go in and adjust that part yourself because you don't want to give a live API key to an AI system like to Claude or to any AI because that's like putting your password out there in the open. You could do it temporarily, like what we did on Friday where we gave it a key. And it uses that to get it all set up completely. Then you can go back and delete that key, generate a new one and ask Claude Code to tell you where to go. Replace that in anywhere that it needs to be updated. So hopefully that's clear. If it's not like you all notice, like, ping us back in chat and we'll walk through it more with you.  \
Them: There's, like, a lot of questions around. I can't find this, or I can't see this. Like, is it worthwhile doing a work through? Like, some people can't find the Echo workflow, some people can't see the Echo workflow, some people can't see the STACKS ui.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: So I don't know.  \
Me: Yeah, let's do this. So what I'll do? Let me just open it completely.  \
Them: Health.  \
Me: New VS code window here and I will come in and let's open this folder it pulled down for me on the desktop. All right. Cool. All right, so this is like a brand new student repo that we've pulled down, and I'm going to open my Claude code. And let me close this out. So this would be like starting from square one now. All right, Claude, this is Tyler. But I am doing a live demo right now for class. Where we are walking through the process of completely setting up end to end our week one homework that we need to do. So I already have VS code set up. I have Claude code installed. Obviously, that's how I'm talking to you, Claude. So I need you to help me walk through and get all this set up so I can complete all the rest of the things that I need to get done for week one. Please, can you list that out and just walk me through? This in really easy to understand workflows, so I know what needs to be done, and I have my own little punch list that we're working off of now, please. Thank you. Okay? So this is again, this is like using Claude as your wingman here to help us figure out how to get through all this stuff. It's going to go look at the documentation that's in the repository. And then it's going to guide us through the entire setup. So here's our punch list. The get installed. So if you have not done that yet.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: There is the GitHub CLI that you'll need to install. We covered that in the Loom Part 1 video. And in fact, when we answer a lot of the question.  \
Them: Tyler. Could you. Sorry. Your prompt in there. They're asking for it in the chat. Could you just, like. I guess everyone. Can you just copy and paste it in there? Yeah.  \
Me: Yeah. I'll drop. That in here. And you'll need to. You all need to adjust that slightly because it's, like, coming as if it's from me, so be sure that.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: You adjust that for yourself there?  \
Them: Yeah. Remove this is Tyler. All of that context, like do it for yourself, basically.  \
Me: Yeah. Exactly. And then right here when the GitHub CLI, because some folks had issues with getting that set up, if you're on a PC, that it becomes more of an issue. Even in answering some of the questions from this weekend. If you ask your Claude. To go in and help with that process. It can look at the answers that we've done. For student answers that are also pushed in here. And it will be able to use that as reference, basically to help walk through that. And we also provided some documentation on Friday that should have been emailed out that covers that specific thing to in case that's a blocker for folks still. So I'm just going to look at this list and I'm going to tell Claude what I've already done and set up. And then it can help me walk through the rest of this, okay? All right, claude. I have git installed and I have the GitHub cli. The repo is not in the best location. It's currently in my desktop, so if you can relocate that to a better spot where it's not going to have any sort of issues, as you know, with icloud syncing, that would be a appreciated. I also have my GitHub account set up I have my Nan cloud account set up. I do have my Google AI studio, my Gmail, Google sheets. All of that in slack are all set up. I have a Claude Pro account, and I have my open router API key. I've done all of that. I can provide you with any of this information that you need, or if you're ready for me to proceed on into Phase three. I'm good with that. Feel free to ask me any questions that I can answer to help you help me. Very Jerry Maguire here to get into phase three, please. Thank you. All right, so we're going to run that through now.  \
Them: Have you guys got your. Your song list or whatever? Your album for this thing going. For this class. The Jerry Maguire thing just reminded me of that.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: All right, here we go. So it's realized and it's moving my repository. If it has not already done this for you all, it should have done this. Where? I don't know how it is on Windows machines, but on Macs.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: With icloud syncing now. It will try. If you leave stuff on your desktop or in your downloads, there are certain areas of your computer, it'll try and just leave like a kind of a shell of the file and then sync it back up to your icloud and not actually leave it on your local computer anymore. Which is not. We don't need that. We don't want that when we're dealing with something like a GitHub repo, because we need the full contents to live on our local computer too. We don't want it to be shipped upstream to iCloud.  \
Them: A bunch of people are asking for that last prompt that you put in. Again. You guys, like, make sure that.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: It's up for you.  \
Me: There we go. Just drop that one in again. So. Yeah. Make sure that you adjust that to fit your use case. And then also. Just because it's a transcription. The models are obviously like, smart not to figure this out, but when I use Mac Whisper, it doesn't always transcribe perfectly. So I noticed whenever I say N8N, if I don't really enunciate that like it put in nan instead, but it knows what I meant. But just calling that out in case you use tools like this as well. All right, so quick action VS code is now pointing to that mood folder. You need to close VS code, reopen it, and then open this folder from where it moved it for me. Okay, cool. So, like, Claude's walking me right through the process here. Or. We can open the Claude code panel again and say, let's continue and run that. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to just copy this little prompt. That it's given me. And in fact, I'm just going to grab this whole thing right here and copy that whole response. You could do that? And I'm going to go here and go to open folder. And I'm going to go to where it moved it to. So it just moved it over here. It made it in my user directory on my Mac. It moved it to a location that's not going to sync to icloud, so we don't have any issues there. And now I'm reopen that reopening Claude code. And I'm just going to give it this message that it gave back. And I'm going to tell it above it. Hey, Claude, we're in that new thread. I have closed out the VS code from our past conversation and reopened it and pointed to the correct folder structure. So you can look at this. Message below where you and I were going back and forth, and we can continue on with this onboarding process, please. Thank you. Okay, cool. All right. Sorry. Does it seem like everybody's kind of following along now?  \
Them: I am like looking at the chat and. The thing. It looks like people are getting an error on the processor node in the echo trigger, which is, like, different from what we're doing right now.  \
Me: Okay? Cool.  \
Them: But a couple have mentioned that. But I think we should walk through this part first.  \
Me: Got. Cha. So, yeah, let's get through this. This will get us up to that stage, and we'll work all the way up to getting to where we need to set up and run the N8N workflows. Just so y'all even see me doing this from scratch, basically, for this. And then while this is running, do we want to go ahead and. Have Rohan, like, come on and we can multitask here or. No, Sorry, do you want to wait?  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: You're. Muted.  \
Them: Oh, I think if a context switch will. Will just lose. Yeah, we'll just lose the flow that people are trying to follow.  \
Me: Okay? Okay? Cool. So, Rohan, if you can hang in there with us for a second, as soon as we get to a stopping point, we'll. We'll kind of open up and do question and answers here in just a minute. From that point of view. All right, so the bridge test is complete. There is an FAQ draft. So this is basically a part of Claude doing the rest of the onboarding process for us. The bridge. If we remember, that is where Claude Code and Claude Desktop can talk back and forth to each other. So we can use the power of both of those tools together. So it's been done, it's written, and it sees that it's working there. Let's see here. So the task effect has been done. Okay? Do I need to do anything to test out the bridge further, or are you saying that we've already vetted and checked that out at this point? And let me see here. Do you have an Nan Cloud account to test? I need the instance, so it's asking for my URL. And what I could do is if I pop back over here into my ARC account, I can just grab a link to any Nan page that I'm on. Let me make sure I'm on the right page here. And drop that in. Also a pro tip here not only for Claude code but for any AI system that you're talking to. Whether it be chat, GBT or whatever. If you are brain dumping to it. And you have multiple different things that you're trying to say or multiple different tasks that you're giving to it, one right after another. A way to separate out those thoughts so that it's very clear to the model what it is that you're doing is to use these three dashes like this. That is the raw markdown equivalent of a line break. So it's no different than if we were putting this in, like, Microsoft Word, let's say. And I had one message responding to something, and then I did three dashes. So it's like 1, 2, 3, like this. And then start with another, you know, train of thought. And if I wanted to continue on, down. And I had yet another thing that I'm responding to, to its response. It helps delineate it. So, like, exactly like how COD Is responding back to me here with line breaks in this instance. And it's making it easy for me to scan through that and know what's up. Returning the favor to your AI is also really helpful to have clear communication with it. So just calling that out as a pro tip there. All right. And also this is a link that I pulled from my Cloud N8N account, so you should be able to get what you need out of this. Please let me know if you have any other questions. And what we have left to get knocked out in our onboarding test. Thank you. And for me. This is for you all. In class here my onboarding, because I've already done the bridge previously and because I already have GitHub set up and things like that. Claude has already checked that and bypassed that now, because I've already done it in the past, and there's not a way for me to replicate that in real time here, because it's already installed on my machine. So if you're doing this process too, and you're getting more things that you're having to stop through, like, walk through with client and get set up. That's okay, and that's normal. I just already have some of these things already set up.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: From they just work on. I've already have them installed on my machine, and so Claude can see that, and that's why it's already ticking the box on them on the list here. So hopefully that's clear on that too. So the bridge test is done. Let's do the innate in check. Now, your instance is this. So it has that. It's basically understanding this is the URL to my account. It's pulling the workflows. Let me see here. All right, Claude, if I did not have my nan MCP setup, and I'm a student setting this up for the very first time, and you went to go pull the nan check. You would most likely be recommending to set up this same N8 NCP, am I correct? Just so that the students and I are on the same page as I'm doing this demo onboarding for them. Okay? So again, I already have the NAN mcp. So it's like a tool that allows the CLAUDE agents to be able to go up and do a lot of actions on our behalf in nan. That's what it did right here. It called the tool, and it asked to see if it could look at the workflows. That are there. We have that documented.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: And let's see here. If the student doesn't have the IT configured, the student can verify without an mcp so it is completely possible to do it. Or you could have the innate NCP install which is covered in a Claude skill that's in there. That will set that up. So you could either do a standard manual N8N check, which Claude could walk you through, or it could explain that there is an NAN MCP that we recommend that is secure, that does everything that we need it to do, and it would walk you through setting up that as well. And we covered that. I believe in the Loom one video, but if anybody has questions on that part, please let me know. So now the next part is going to be do you have your Gemini API key? If yes, share it. I'll test if it works, then you can regenerate a new fresh one for security. If no, click here and generate one. So I'm going to go ahead and do this just to walk through this process. I'm going to click on the Google AI Studio link that it gave me. I already have an API key, but I'll generate a new one just to show what this looks like. If you've come here and you have not even set up a Google AI Studio account, you'll need to do that first. It's just like a simple app sign up just like anything else with Google here. And then once you get that done, you can navigate to this page for the API keys and click Create API key. When you do that. You might not have a project set up yet if you've never used this tool before. So you could just click Create project, name it and walk through the process of creating a new project. It's really self explanatory and not too difficult at all. And once you have that done, you can just select one. So I'll select this Gemini API project here. I'm going to name it as. Let's call this MV Monday 12 8, 25 test. Just so I'll remember what it is, I'm going to hit Create key. So I've just named this new API key. And now that has added it right here and I can click on this copy button. This is the good thing about Google. They make it. Most places when you generate an API key, it'll flash it up on the screen. You need to copy it. Once you close out that window, you won't be able to see the key anymore for security reasons. Google and a few other places do it a little bit differently, where it generates the key and stores it so you can just copy it on the keyboard and you don't have to worry about if you close out the screen, you're going to lose it kind of thing, all right? I'm going to come back in here. All right, Claude, thank you. I have now got my Google API key set up, and I'm providing it below if you want to check to make sure everything works good there and then proceed to walk me through this onboarding, please. Thank you. All right, so now I'm going to do my three dashes again. I'm going to paste in my key just so it knows that it's something different, and hit send. All right. Are we still keeping up here? Sars? Like from the chat? Do I need to slow down and cover anything else?  \
Them: Yeah, I feel like. People are putting in that they're, like, getting the ticks and stuff like that on the onboarding. So, guys, I just want to. Because I know someone asked, can we do a step by step of, like, part two of the homework and all of that? We just want to make sure that everybody is set up first. So that's why we're, like, making sure that we're going through it again.  \
Me: Yeah, and we're. We're working towards the part two for sure.  \
Them: Yeah, we are.  \
Me: We're trying to get everybody on the same page so that we don't skip ahead to part two.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: And you haven't even made it this far. Like, yo, y'all are way ahead of me. It's not making sense yet.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Okay, so security step is important. Your API key works good. But Claude's telling you the same way that we are now. You need to go and delete that. So go to AI Studio, API key. Delete the key that we just shared in the chat history, generate a new one to actually use in class, and save. It as a new key in a password manager. So if you have something like 1Password or dash lane or a secure note. That you use. Like, you can paste it into there just so we have it for later. The onboarding is complete. Here again, this mine has, like, skipped a few things because it's checked and it sees that things have already been done. Such as? Like the setup, sh. And some other things. So yours might take a little bit longer than what I'm showing right here if you're doing this for the very first time. But once you get to this stage, we're now done with, like, part one. Of the week one homework of, like, getting all of our. Workshop set up to get all of our work done in here. So first things first. Let me go do this just at a good practice before I forget to do this myself and so everyone else can see this. This is the new API key that I just made. And so I'm going to click on this and click delete key. Delete. And now my test key that I did for Claude to be able to go use and make sure it's working properly and get us set up part of the way, we don't have to worry about that being exposed anywhere. And if it is, it won't be a valid key anymore, so it won't. Work for anyone else. So. All right, we're good with that. All right. Great. So now the part two of my homework is that I'm supposed to be going in and working on getting the echo workflows set up. And. And getting that part going. So can you look in the repo to understand what all else I'm supposed to have done before week one is complete so that I'm prepped and ready for week twos Wednesday class? Thank you. All right. Cool. So now we're going to switch gears and get into, like, week two part, which is, I think, where a lot of the people's questions are coming in from and asking Claude, if you use the key word, explore that signals. And we'll have Claude go spin up and I don't know if. I said explore right there, but I should have that for that. That triggers Claude code to spin up sub agents to then go out and consume a lot more information. So, like, as you might imagine, as we talked about context window, I think last Wednesday, that's the amount of short term memory that an agent has and it's not infinite. Right. And so there's more information in all of these folders and files. If we like blue all of the way, then one claude agent by itself could go and read. So if you tell it to go and explore the repo to fully be up to speed and come back and brief you on it,  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: It will spin up sub agents to go and do that in a targeted way and to go consume as much context as it can, distill that down and bring it back to the main agent. So it's up to speed. So that's a really good tip, not only for this class, but if you ever go do this in the future and, and you get added onto a repo or you go to a GitHub repository that's some sort of like an open source project and you need to, you want to understand it, right? By telling it to go explore the repository, that's what you're signaling and if you tell it to explore it thoroughly or some like the the adjective that you use there matters too is like the intensity that it'll go do that process. All right, so homework part two.  \
Them: Oh, yes, I was just going to do that. I wanted to make a clear cut, guys, so that everyone knows where they're at right now. We just set up everything in part one. Like we've done part one now. So we've got everything set up on the onboarding. Now we're going on to part two. Remember, part two of the homework. Is the process, now that you're set up, of how we're going to customize the sugar agent, and in order for us to do that, We need to give it our brand voice. So that's where we're going to head to next. And also give the sugar agent the information. So I just wanted to, like, make that clear cut over here. And, Tyler, everyone's asking for that last prompt before we get going. Too late.  \
Me: Yeah. All right. Hold on. Okay? I think it was. Here. I think is right. All right, copy that. Paste this in. I will also. Like when we're done with class today too, I'll take our transcript from class. And surprise, I'll give it to Claude Code and have it extract out all of the parts where I was prompting Claude Code, and we'll see if we can't put that into, like, a document and. And share that. Back with you all as well. And Claude can probably go in and take what I've said and clean it up even more so that it'll. It will work better for you all moving forward. So let's see here. All right, so homework, part two. What you need for this. There's five steps to complete. We're going to need to create a knowledge base in Google AI Studio. Cool. We're going to need to upload our documents to the knowledge base. We're going to create the Megadoc for our writing samples. Run the Echo workflow to get our brand voice via email. And add our brand voice XML to our sugar agent is what it's talking about there. So the first thing that we need to do. Is. And okay, so this is a good learning point right here is if for some reason. Like you're reading through this. And like, if I read this first thing right here of like, hey, create a knowledge base. The stacks. Go to AI Studio. Create a corpus document collection. Save your corpus ID for later. No, Claude. No, thank you. Like sometimes it will try. Even with our instructions. It will try and. Like put work back on the person. And I always go back and remind the agent. And it's what you guys can do as well is tell it. Hey, I'm wanting you to go and execute on as much of this work as possible. And you only ping me back for the things that you explicitly need my help in doing. This is not one. Of those things. So let me show you how. I'm going to have Claude help me set this step one part up right here. Hey, Claude. So when I'm seeing your steps here, even just like reading step one, I. I stopped right away because my understanding was that from Tyler and Sarah in their demos and videos, is that you would be able to go in and help me set up my stacks and all of the pieces that connect into that from. Innate in. To be able to have my knowledge base all set up with the library and everything. So can you go and explore the repo? And then come back and tell me what you can go do. Give me the handover prompt to give to a brand new Claude code thread that I will copy and paste. And you in that new thread will set up my stacks and my Gemini. All of it, everything for me. And you only tell me the parts that I explicitly need to go in and take care of on my end. Thank you. All right. And. I'll go ahead and grab this prompt and check it in as well. Cool. So this is what it's going to do again. This is a good task. I'm diverging a little bit. From what you guys might see in the documentation on how to do this. Is it teachable moment, basically. Sarah will tell you. When we're in Claude code, we generally have at least two threads open and it's called clotting is like the what the cool kids on Twitter X call it these days. And that basically means that you have multiple conversations going at the same time with Claude co and I generally have like five of them going at the same time, at least. It's ridiculous. One of them is a, like a project manager type thread. That's how I'm treating this main thread that we've been working in right now. And when I get to a step that I need to, to take some sort of an action, Or go do tasks that I know it's going to be like a decent amount of work. I'll tell Claude to basically write up the spec or the documentation on how to go do this task with complete context and give me a prompt. To give to a new Claude code that I will post or like paste and give it to, and a new thread to go and execute on that on my behalf. And that allows you to have a project management thread that helps you, like, go back and forth with and preserve the context window in this chat. And in the new chats that we spin up, they're very, like, task focused and they're like the doer, the worker. Be agents is a good way of thinking of it. And the reason to do it in a completely new thread.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Versus having Claude just spin up its own sub agent in this project management thread is because you can. If you think of the hierarchy here, we're talking to the main agent right now in Claude code, and it's able to spin up sub agents. But those sub agents cannot also spin up a third layer of sub agents. They're not able to do that, and on purpose. Right, so we don't get into this infinite loop of Claude making more clauds and this whole like, multiplicity effect or something in there. Instead, we take the prompt that it gives. Us if we do this technique. And copy this and we take this into a new conversation. And paste this in. And now this homework part 2, knowledge base setup is very task focused on just helping me with this process right now. And so now I I have a worker B thread going and when it executes on things I can come back and update and tell this project management type thread that we have going right? Here, where, where we are in that process, and it can help keep us moving forward, if that makes sense. So it's, it's even explaining here saying what this prompt will do is it checks your NADM workflows. There's nothing to watch. It launches the stacks and explains open the Browser to LocalHost 3000. It's going to create a store via the N8N API, paste the API key if it's at when we're asked. It's going to research and create knowledge based content files, tell ityour business name and guides upload the process. So it's going to tell you how to go do this stuff. Ok, so if we come back over here to this doer thread, And hit? Yes. We're going to let this keep working. While that's working too. There's nothing wrong. With just continuing on. And if we just would have done this all in one thread, there's nothing wrong with that at all. The problem you're going to run into, though, is that you might run out of context window in this thread right here, and it will do what's called compacting. Compacting is a feature that Anthropic has that goes and looks at your existing conversation history in this thread and tries to redact out parts that are not as relevant anymore. So it's trying to basically clear out as much as it can from the past conversation to free up space in the context window. To carry on. But if you do that too many times, you'll get like degradation in its memory in this thread. So that's why I try and start splitting out tasks. I've built that habit out here. So that's why I wanted to call that out for you all, and it's easier. Just to kind of show it than to talk to it.  \
Them: And you'll see it in the thinking traces just on like normal code. When you're in there, it will say something like condensing or something, so we can continue our conversation. So yeah.  \
Me: Yeah, it's very aware of it, Claude. They built into the new opus model, the 4.5 model and Sonic 4.5, to have context, window anxiety, so it knows when it's going to be running close to its limits on that, so that it's thinking about going ahead and compacting that down. So it saves space, basically. Cool. So this is going to take just a second for it to get all of this set up. And then it will come back and tell us, like, what it's doing along the way. And I've expanded this too, so when you're in Claude code, the thinking traces like what Sorrow was just saying. It has a little carrot window right here, if you click on that. It expands it out. So that's its internal thoughts. And then if you collapse that, you can see what it's actually saying back to us in the conversation, which is meant to be user facing, I guess, is the best way to put it. Cool. So now it has this set up and it's even telling us the Stacks is now running at local host 3000. It's not telling me to open it yet, but I'm just going to. While we're waiting on it. So if we click on this, let's go see if it's working properly. Boom. Okay, cool. So we have stacks set up here. And again, because I've done this before on my local computer, and that's stored in my local systems cache. It's going to have some details populated in here already, but Claude would walk me through the process of what I need to do. Mainly, I'm going to need to take my brand new Gemini API key and down here in the Settings section, I'm going to paste that in and it's going to tell me webhook URL I need to put in here and how to create my first store in here as well. So the store is like section in the library if we want to use the lingo from last week. All right, so, yes. So again, Claude is setting up my NAN workflows and it's going to look slightly different for mine than it does for y'alls, because it's checking my N8N account and already have the workflows in there. You all wouldn't have that yet, so it would be pushing. The workflows out of this folder that you downloaded into your N8N account. And getting all that done. So that's how yours would look slightly different than mine because it's doing it for the first time, or updating them, rather, if it's doing that, and then it will come back and tell me what we need to do manually, so.  \
Them: Can I? Can I. Sorry. Are you okay with me interrupting you?  \
Me: Always.  \
Them: You're. You're used to it by now. I just want to. I'm trying to keep the temp check, like, making sure that I'm communicating, like, and making sure that everybody's on the same wavelength. So people are going to asking, like, where are we? Not where are we now, where the stacks fit and stuff like that. And echo. So just to clarify, stacks and echo are parked Part two of the week one homework, where part one was just the onboarding. Now we're in part two, and some people have been asking. I thought I was, like, way down the track with part two homework, but I don't recall the stack spit. So do you want to make sure that people understand all of that?  \
Me: Yeah. Okay, so let me back back up here to where we were. So phase one. All right, I'll leave it right here. So, yes, what the stacks is, is let me launch it just so we can see it while we talk to it. This is just a. A website, basically. That we've built to be a front end for Google's Gemini file search. And Google's Gemini file search is a rag retrieval like vector database product. That allows us to put our. Our information into there and make it accessible to our AI agents. And because Google and their infinite wisdom did not build a front end UI for their own product. Well, we, we did that. So we basically built out this front end little website right here. It runs 100% locally on your own computer. So if when I launch localhost 3000 and you launch localhost 3,000. It's not looking at the same stacks. If that makes sense. Like it launches the same website template. But yours runs in isolation on your local computer, and mine does as well on. My computer. And the reason for this is because we needed an easy way to be able to upload the files into our knowledge base, into our library. And that's what this allows us to do. This allows us to be the front end. And I'll go look at Nan to kind of complete this thought here for y'all. This allows us to grab something to. Let me just grab anything here. If I grab this one. Open it and upload it. Now you can see it just uploaded this document that I just set into this QA API test file. And it even gives me that information in here. Like, right here is where it is, and it tells me that it's active and what kind of file it is. If I wanted to delete that, I can just. Click delete. It's going to tell me. Hey, are you sure you want to? Yeah. Let's delete it. Okay, so if you ever get this, like, an error, even during any of this setup, I'm glad I did that right there. Then it's going to. That's something we're going to take back to Claude and tell it what you were trying to do and give it the error that you got. Because that should have deleted this. And for some reason in this, like, spin up, like, who knows? We're not going to go into the trouble of debugging that right now, but it didn't want to delete that for some reason. Right here. We have an activity log, so if you missed that little pop up down here, you can just come in and highlight the activity log and give that to Claude code if you ever need to. But what this does is it gives us a front end to upload and delete and manage multiple different sections of a library and what files we want to add into it that Google does not give out of the box. So that's what this is. Now. This is just the front end. It doesn't actually do anything. It's just an interface for what we have running on the back end over here in N8N. That's what the knowledge base management web hooks are doing. So you have these as well. And as part of this onboarding process that you're walking through with Claude, it will pull these over, set them up, and also connect them to your local stacks setup, like that front end. And so when we go in and we make a new section in the library in that front end. Ui and we. We create, like, a Tyler's brand voice section of the library. And that's what we want to call it, let's say. And then I take my. My brand voice analyses that I got from the Echo workflow, and I want to put it into that section of the library when I make that new? It's called a store is what the section is when we click that button on that front end website in the stacks. What happens on the back end is it sends that to this webhook right here, and it goes and does this information for us. Same thing. If we delete a document, it sends it to this web hook. When we upload a new document, like this one right here, it uploads it to Gemini on our behalf. So this is kind of like what happens on the backside when you click a button on the front end, so hopefully that kind of completes.  \
Them: Yeah. So we still need to unconfuse a couple of things on the stacks. People are asking, like what?  \
Me: The circle there.  \
Them: So I think they're. They're kind of thinking, like, if all of the information they're asking more or less, if all the information's in there, why do we need to use it? We're using the stacks. For what? Tyler, can you, like, very clearly say what stacks, how they're going? To be using stacks.  \
Me: Y.  \
Them: Forget about all the back end stuff.  \
Me: Es. Yes. They're going to be using as a student the stacks to just add in your personal brand voice folders. You're going to need to do that, or analyses rather. You're going to need to take each of the. Let me get back over here. Each of the Hattie B's information around their menu and their hours of operation, all this, like, sample data that we have in the repository. So it's in the GitHub repository, but it's not in your personal Google Gemini file store. It's not in the stacks yet. So you're going to need to grab those files. And add them into there the Hattie B's information. So.  \
Them: You guys. Sorry. You guys are creating a library. That's what you're. Right now, there are books that exist in a portal, but you need to put it into the library in your version, so that when you're running your echo workflow and all of that kind of. Sorry, your workflow, when you have. The customer service department team, they have access to the library. To the library with the books in it. So that's why you're doing it, because it doesn't like you're actually porting it over, essentially.  \
Me: Now. That's correct. Yeah, that's what? Like we are providing you all already the stuff that needs to go into the library, minus your personal brand voice. Like you have to do that on your own in the echo flow. But it just is in GitHub, right? Like, it's just in that repository. It doesn't mean it's in Google Gemini yet. So that's why we're having you add those books into your personal library that you've set up and created here.  \
Them: Yeah, so that's the difference, guys, because, like, you're like, wait a minute, it's already in GitHub, but it's not in your Google. Like, it's not in your. The area. The. The library, which your agents will need access to. When you build the workflow.  \
Me: Correct. And so. And then if we go back over here, just to connect the dots once more. Like, why do we have the. The library? Like, just to put a final thing on it.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: It's because this workflow right here in N8N this is the email. Answering workflow that we're going to be doing on starting on Wednesday. This is what we're going to be putting together that has all of the emails that hit that PASCO and enter into the Hattie B's customer service email pipeline. It's going to go to these different agents in here. And if we go look at Just like the Hatch agent as an example, it's connected to a librarian tool. The library. And Tool is another agent, like a sub agent. The librarian that is connected to your library that you have in Gemini. So when Hatch gets customer service email, that's like, hey, do y'all have, I don't know, is your food Alpha Gal safe or something like that? Hatch can go and ping the library in to go. Look at your knowledge base. And pull an answer from your own uploaded data. In addition to, we'll actually add in a web search feature here too, so we can look both in the library and on the open Internet. Both. To be as. As informed as we can make it to answer this question. So that's, like. That's the why behind all of this.  \
Them: So. Yeah. And so imagine your agent has got a little librarian. Like, imagine a little lady with how or a little man. However you want to imagine, right, that your, like, your agents got access to.  \
Me: Right.  \
Them: This agent, this librarian, when the agent's like, hey, librarian, go get me the information I need. That librarian needs to access a building with the library books. Right. So that's what you're doing through the process that we just described before. Otherwise there's no connection, right? So does that make sense, guys?  \
Me: Also, like one other thing to call out here, and we. We push this update to be more clear, mainly for Claude, even more than for y'all. When you're doing this process, especially this is for, like, Google, Gemini specifically. They recently changed the, the language on how they refer to some of this stuff. Where they call it like a corpus. Like, even I noticed it in this conversation. And it's. It's hard for us to, like, completely weed that out of Claude's thinking because it's in its clawed models, training data. And so it's. Even though we're telling it, hey, it's no longer called a corpus. Google updated that and they call it, like, file store. File search or something along those lines. Like that could. That could cause some language, like, issues or barriers in here too, and just. I'll. I'll do it here in a minute, so you'll see what. How we need to do it. But that's where Claude will go in and get up to speed on this to like, correct its thinking. And then set this up the rest of the way. So, like, even right here, you can see, like, Corpora. It's trying to launch that, to, like, add information into it. Okay, so here it's launched the STACKS knowledge base. We're going to upload our information into it. Let me come down here. What you need to do now. Manual steps. Configure the stack settings. Click on the settings at the bottom of the page. Enter in your Gemini API key. So that brand new one that we would have made, which I I went and did. Give it your nan webhook base URL, which is this one right here. Like what we it's going to give it straight to you. Yours will be different. Than what you see on my screen because it's for your NAD account. And then click save API key. So that's telling us to go do that in the stacks section. And so that would be. Let me relaunch it so we have it to talk to. It's telling you to click on the settings. Right Here is the API key where you're going to paste it in. And right here is where the web hook is going to be, where you're going to paste that in. All right. And then. When we come back over here so we can come back and tell this Claude thread. Hey, I've got that done. Let's see what it's saying in phase four. So, Phase four, Preview. Understanding the Knowledge Base Content Structure. I've reviewed the demo knowledge base for Hattie B's Hot Chicken, and here's what you'll need to create for your business. So again, Claude is trying to. We've written this in a way where it will help you both forward the class, but also even after the class. So it's thinking that we're trying to do this, like, for something after the class, so I'm going to correct it right here. Hey, Claude. So I see that you're wanting to go ahead and get into phase four, your previewing that. I wanted to let you know that I have my webhook and my API key are in the settings in the stacks, and I've saved that and so we're good there. We are supposed to be all working and building towards the Hattie B's. Hot chicken in class is what Tyler and Sara said. And so I'm not going to be doing this. For my business on this run. I'm going to be doing this as I'm working for Hattie B's. So I need you to give me all of the different files that I need to upload or point me to on that I need to upload into my stacks, please. And make sure that I cover everything here. Thank you. Okay? Let me grab this and paste it in again. There we go. All right. So it recognizes that it understands what we're working on. The class example that we're going to be doing this, we already have the files made and provided to you all. So when it gives me these links, if I click on them, it will launch the file so I have it. You can also go find it based on where it's telling you where it is. So if we click on, it's right here. So it's in the repo, it's demo, Hattie B's knowledge base content and then there's brand, voice, FAQ locations, menu and policies.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: And it's going to tell you to go grab each of these and add them in. So the easiest way to do that is if we go back over into the stacks. Let me reopen that again. Right here. I'm just going to merge that into my Zoom so I can open it easily. So I go back over into Stacks. I'm going to click on this section to upload. I'm going to navigate to where my repository is on my local computer. It's just like going to look at their folder system. I'm going to click on the demo section. And underneath that we have haddb's and then we have knowledge based content right here. And so I can now go and grab these and hit open. And. There we go. It's saying uploaded, uploaded, faq. It's successfully uploading all of these and logging that right here. And now they've shown up. So now I have all five of the Hattie Bees documents added into my Stacks knowledge base and it synced it over to Google. So we're, like, golden at this point. The only other things that we would need to do. Is, we would need to get our brand voice analyses by running the Echo workflow and add that into here as well. But we've got to run Echo first, so we're not quite there yet in this walkthrough that we're doing, so I can close this out. I can come back over here to my Claude code thread. And tell it. Howdy, bees. Knowledge base ready to upload. Okay, so it's telling me, walking me through, exactly how to do this, to create a new file store. In case you haven't done that yet, name it as Hattie B's Knowledge Base and hit create. Upload all five files, which we have now done, and then we're good. So I'm just going to tell it what I've done now. All right, Claude, I have found all five of those files. Thank you for giving them to me. And I've successfully added them into my stacks, and they're showing that they successfully uploaded. I've even included the activity log below, so you have that as well. Thank you. All right, so I'm going to do three dashes again. Let me pop back over here. I'm literally just going to select the activity log and just paste that in also, just so it has it. And we're going to hit go. Claude has the ability. To go and, well, if we gave it another API key, go and check to make sure that it did actually create the stores and all that stuff on our behalf. If we wanted to validate that.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: But we know that it's working because we got success on the other end. It wouldn't have done that unless it actively did that. So now it's telling me, homework part two is complete. Well, at least for this part of it, it is. So now what we need to do is copy this, because, remember, this is the Worker B thread. I'm going to go back over here to this thread. And. I'm going to do three dashes, paste in the message from the other one. And come back up here. All right, Claude, I have now finished in my Worker B thread where I was working on homework part two and I was able to get my N8N set up. The stacks is set up and I have the Hattie B's knowledge base. Added into the workflow. I believe I still have some more work to be done, though, to finish all the way with all of my week one homework. So look at this and walk me through what we need to do next, please. Thank you. All right. So this will take just a second, hopefully. This is, like, making more sense now that we're kind of walking through this and you all are seeing.  \
Them: We do have a whole bunch of questions, Tyler, but I just said to the team that we'll get through the demo.  \
Me: This after.  \
Them: And then we'll answer. Because if we keep jumping around, then it will actually cause more confusing and confusion. Yeah.  \
Me: I agree with that. So we'll go full Q and A here in a minute. And then still you all like the way that if you still have questions that are blocked, If you add those questions into the Google form, we see those and have been responding to them, even with the screenshots and everything. Those have been super helpful and we've been answering them and then pushing the responses back up into GitHub. So if you ask your Claude code and we're going to be pinging the Mind Valley team to let them know when we've answered different people's questions.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So that you all know that you can go and check as we've responded to them. So even if you still are running into blockers after a class today or throughout the rest of this week, Continue to use that same Google form. And we're watching that and answering those and then pinging back the responses on them.  \
Them: Yeah, for sure. Guys. Like, we'll still make sure that you get to the finish line before Wednesday, okay? And people are asking for that prompt before you lose it.  \
Me: Okay? Cool. Let's see. Which one was it? It was this one right here. All right, cool. All right, so this is the prompt that I chucked back into kind of my onboarding project manager right here. Let me do it. Why is it not let me do it. All right, copy. What? My. Okay? I don't. Know, it's being weird for me here. I'm going to see if I could send it to you in slacks Are. See if you can get it on there. Yeah, because it's blocking me. You might need to be split up or something into more than one message, maybe. Okay. All right, so here we go. So homework, Week one, status. We have the stax knowledge base store. The Gemini workflows. Complete the echo workflows. Ready. But I'm going to tell it again because my Echo workflows are already in. My N8N setup because we built them and shared them out. So it's seeing my existing ones. I'm going to force it to go back and create new, like, pull down the new ones out of the student repo and add them as, like, new workflows so we can walk through that as well. Just like what you all would be going through. Just to call out how that's going to be, like, slightly different right here. So what's left? Sips three through five. We need to get the echo workflows run set up. We need to run the echo workflows, and then we need to add our analyses into the stacks, into the knowledge base. And then we need to take our XML snippet and personalize sugar, so that's what we need to do. All right. Okay? Claude, I'm going to give you a little bit of a Path diverged here. You are correct, and we do have. We do need to set up the echo workflows. Run the echo workflows. Grab our brand voice analyses, add all those into the stack so that they're in the knowledge base. And we need to personalize our sugar agent so it sounds more like us. With the XML output that we get as well once that's done. So here's what we need to do. Since this is actually Tyler doing this. And when you look in my Innate in an account, I already have Echo workflows set up and running in there. I want you to create or add in two new Echo workflows from this student repo that we're in right now and label them so that we know that they are somehow delineated that it's a test from today that I'm doing live so I can remove them later. But I'm wanting to walk through this process again as if I'm a student. And we have not yet done this process. So they can see that illustrated here in class. I don't want you to do that in this thread again. I want you to think through this. Spec it out completely and give me the prompt to give to a new worker BE agent, please. Thank you. All right, so let's do that. And I'm going to go ahead and close out this other one. I can do that now, since we're done with that. Previous worker B, and I've opened a fresh Claude code thread, so I've got that one ready for when this finishes up. And I will paste this one in here as well. But again, this prompt that I'm adding in right now. Is very specific to me because, as you all can see, Sorry. I'm sending it to you in Slack again because I think it's not wanting to.  \
Them: Yeah, I'm having trouble copying and pasting into slack. I mean zoom. The zoom chat won't let me paste.  \
Me: It might be like you need to split it or something. It might be over the character limit or something. But anyway, that last prompt I gave it is slightly different, as you all can deduce from that. That because I already have Echo workflows in my N8 in account, when it checks, it's like, oh cool, it's already done. Tick that box for you all. That wouldn't be the case. You wouldn't have had it, wouldn't have added these in yet. So that's why I'm forcing it to kind of go back and redo this for me, like, brand new.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So that I can do this demo. Okay, so let me highlight all of this. And I'm going to come all the way down here to. The very bottom. So it gave me this whole prompt right here. I'm going to copy this. And it's even telling me what this is doing here. So let me double check it. So it's going to import the workflow, configure and activate, create the Megadoc, submit the form, give the URL and instructions. We're going to run it, upload it to Slack, update our sugar and do the cleanup. So it actually is trying to do a bunch of this. Over here at the same time. And I'm going to paste this in. Let me show you all another little pro tip here. Not just for class, but for moving forward. It's this phrase. I want you to use subagents as much as possible to protect your context window and because teamwork makes the dream work. Go get them, slugger. All right. So I will paste this little nugget in here that you all can add on any Claude code prompt that you send through if you just put that at the very end of it. What that forces it to do. Is it causes it. Remember, there's like a main agent in this thread, and that main agent can spin up sub agents. So little minions and the little minions context windows are all individual of each other and the main one. And because that's telling this main agent to act as more of an orchestrator agent and not actually be the one that's taking all the action, but to know what actions need to happen and delegate that to sub agents, it has it run faster if you do that. It has it like they're more. Task specific in the sub agents so they do a better job. It preserves the context window so you're not going to burn through your limit as fast in here. So that little snippet there at the end of that. I want you to use subagents as much as possible. Protect your two, protect your context. Window. And because teamwork makes the dream work. Go get them slugger. That is a thing called emotion prompting, which is a science research backed technique that if you. Are convey emotion like that in your prompt to an AI System. It will increase the quality of the work that they do. It's, like, been proven over and over again. It works both for positive and negative reinforcement. I just would advise you to stay on the positive side, which I'm pretty sure everybody in here is. Going to do anyway because these agents tend to not forget a lot. And they have humanoid robot bodies here now and in the future. So be kind to your bots, y'all. Alexa might come back and get you someday.  \
Them: Glory is like I knew it would come after me.  \
Me: You're mean to. Yeah.  \
Them: But yeah, it is actually a research based technique. It's not just us being Tyler being so nice to his bots. Yes, also that.  \
Me: Yeah. So it actually works. That's some of the interesting thing. Like, while this is running, Some of the biggest breakthroughs in AI research actually come out of socio, demographic and psychological research in humans and how we work and respond to things. And so if we were working on a team together, and I'm positively reinforcing you, you're probably going to do a better job. If we're working on a team together and I tell you, get this thing done or you're out of here, like, we're firing you, you're probably going to work a little bit harder too. Like, again. So it's like this, sort of. Because it works in humans. It's. It's. An emergent behavior that also shows up in AI systems because they're trained on massive amounts of data on, on us. Like, is where it came from. And so that's why it shows up in the way that they work too, which is, is fascinating. But that's why I, like I used to say Well, I still say it all the time, but I used to say early just myself talking to bots. I tell gigawatt, go get them, slugger. Just to kind of gaslight gigawatt and have it to go do a good job. And people kept hearing that and sorry, I heard it. And so now it's like my catchphrase. Like, I'll tell my agents all the time. Like, go get them, slugger. It's just a funny little thing I do. But yeah.  \
Them: Oh, yeah, everybody. No one knows about gigawatt. Gigawatt is like everyone's gigawatt is. Are. Is the. Is the bot. I was going to say the man, but the bot.  \
Me: Y. Eah.  \
Them: It's a lot of old bots. For sure. Gigawatt.  \
Me: Yeah. Gigawatt is like my. My personal AI agent that I've been using for years now. And it specializes. There's multiple versions of it, but, like, the main one that most people know it for is I have an AI engineering version of it that can help you, like, build things, build prompts, build workflows.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Like all this kind of stuff. It was doing kind of what Claude Code does in some extent. Before Claude Code was here with their agent Harness and everything. So it's pretty fun. Let's see. Here. All right. So. All right.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Phase 1 and 2 are complete. Here's the status report. So, here we go. So the echo workflow is. Let's see here. December, I think. Echo trigger is inactive. Needs activation. Echo processor is existing. It's active. Already configured with credentials. So again, because this is mine and it's looking at my workflows. That are already built. It tried to cut a corner here for me and save some processing power of not rebuilding it. I'm going to tell it to do it anyway because I want it to start completely from scratch. It's giving me the configuration path and what I need to go and do. Cool. All right. Let's see here. All right, this is excellent. But I see that you went ahead and went with the existing Echo processor agent. And what I wanted to have happen, because this is a full demo live to show the students the experience that they will have, is to go and make another edition of the Echo processing workflow that you will find in this student repo and you can go and add it into my innate in account and label it. So it's very easy for me to delineate between this new demo version and the existing ones that I already have in my N8N account. So please spin up a sub agent to go do that specific thing and then come back and tell me what I need to do next, please. Thank you. All right. The other thing I see that it's already trying to tell me is done. That it's done is it's created a mega doc. The mega doc is the examples of our writing. Okay. And I've already done this, and obviously I think it's found this on my computer somewhere, which it can do, which is what's wild if you ask it to, rather. This to do this for you. Also, if you can gather different transcripts or emails or social media posts, you gather all that stuff together. Just add it into a folder. And if you put it into the repository, or even if you just put it on your desktop or your downloads, it really doesn't matter. Just, like, put it on your computer. Tell Claude code where it is and tell it hey, here's the examples of my writing. I need you to go look at all this and connect it together and make a singular megadoc for me based on that that I can then run in the echo workflow and it will go do that for you. It'll take and grab all those files, make a new, like, Mega Doc file and append and label everything properly and put it together. So, again, it's like a new level of AI Laziness here, as you can have AI even do, like, these sorts of things that in the past that actually would have taken. A little bit of time to go and find all that stuff and pull it down and paste it in. So that's possible now, even if you have online. If you have an online presence, so you have blog posts or videos that have transcripts online or social media posts, you can have Claude spin up sub agents. To go pull down verified examples of your communication style and add those into the Mega Dock if you want, and it can go out on the Internet and do that for you. It's pretty wild. All right. So let's see here. Okay, so it understood. It's getting a fresh demo copy of the Echo processor workflow. So the big part of the workflow from Echo, it's adding that in now. It's creating that. It's going to take it just a second. Sub agent couldn't find the create tool but have access to it. So let me create the demo. So it's doing that now. It's always interesting to watch that. Or at least I find it fascinating. Is like watching this agent. Think through its process and talk to its sub agents. They go do things and then how it troubleshoots things because it runs into errors. Just like you and I would like messing around in this tool. And it's like, oh, crap, I'm trying this thing, I'm trying to upload it, but it's not working. I need to think about a new way to try and do this. And it will just sit there and loop on it until it figures it out or until it hits a checkpoint where it comes back to us, the people, and reports what's going on and gives us options on how we proceed, basically. But it's pretty wild. I have not found very many blockers, hardly any at all, that I could not tell Claude to go back and spin up agents and sub agents to go research this problem that we're running into. To come up with the answer to help us fix and troubleshoot this, like, whatever it might be. Just as you run into it. These things are wild. All right. So this thing is still riding its workflow, is pushing it up now, hopefully. There we go. All right, so it's created. It let me collapse the thinking so I can read what it's trying to tell me now. So I processed it successfully. It's added it all up there. Let me hit. Yes. All right, so now we have fresh workflows for the demo. Good to go. Both of them are inactive, and now it's telling me what I need to go and do. And again, this is generative AI so what my cloud code tells me right here might be slightly different than what it tells you all when you do the same process.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So what you need to do in manual steps. Is. It's telling me to go to here, open the demo. So let's just go ahead and do this. So here. All right, let me move this over. So it's telling me to activate the demo and activate this. So that's easy enough. Like, just turn them both on. So here they are right here. Demo trigger and demo processor. So toggle that on active. Toggle this on to active. Okay, that's about easy as it gets. Cool. Phase 3 mega dock. So I talked through how you would go and do that just a second ago. I'm going to skip over that par for right now just because I think unless someone needs me to demo it or show that off, I'm happy to do it. But essentially you're just going to either go gather examples of your own writing or communication of different formats. And put them into a folder, or just like put them into a singular location, tell Claude where they are, or even just paste them into the chat if you want to do that also for Claude, and then tell it to turn them into a megadoc file that you could then add into the Echo workflow. And once you have that, then you're off to the races. So I'm going to do that, but I'm going to do it with an existing. Mega doc that Claude's made for me. Previously in here. So let me go to the echo trigger. And I'm going to click on the echo form right here. And production URL. Copy this. And I'm going to paste this in. And I'm going to fill this out now, so let's go. I'm just going to send this to. What am I going to send? Let's do. Let's just go. Tyler at. Aibuildlab. Com. And let's go personal. And my name. Be sure that you have your name here, as it would appear in the transcripts also, or at least closely to what it's going to appear as. And then my writing samples. Let me go grab that really quickly. Where'd my finder window go? New finder window. GitHub. Now. I'm trying to remember where this is at. Okay, so. It is in the dev. I think it was in bridge results. Is it two or three? Two. In fact, why am I searching for this? Let's use Claw to help me figure this out. Okay, I have a Mega Dock already created, but it is on my local machine in my mind. Valley Dev Repo. I believe it's in the bridge in the results section. Somewhere in there. Just to try and help narrow the search for you. And it's like Tyler Megadoc, if you go look for that or have a sub agent go look for that, and then bring me the path to that so that I can go straight and. Or actually just bring me the contents of that file so I can copy and paste it into my form and run this. Echo workflow that we've set up in this thread, please. Thank you. So again, I am literally just, like, vaguely describing and telling Claude, hey, I have this file on my computer. Here's roughly the place where I think it is. It's going to spin up a subagent. To go and look for it in that area of my computer, and when it finds it, it found it that fast, faster than me. And it's going to bring that back. So here it is. Tyler's brand voice, megadoc that I made before. And it's going to give this to me in the chat right here, so I can just copy and paste it into my form. So this is what I'm talking about, or Sar and I were talking about when we're saying, like, this is.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: A completely new way of working. Of just how much stuff you can offload. The cognitive load of that into a system like this is wild. Okay, so it's right here. Found it. I can just click on this and it'll actually open it. There we go. So copy that. Now. Here's that form. I'm going to paste this sucker in here. And then I just need to delete a few things off. The end that I know it wrote is just like notes that we don't need. All right, cool. So there's that, and I hit submit. Then you'll see this analysis started. It protects your email and it's saying, hey, you'll get an email here. It'll take about five to ten minutes. Which it will. That will run. And then I'll get the email with those brand voice analyses. Once I get those back, That's when I'm going to come back over here into the stacks and upload that here. So now it's added into my knowledge base also. And the other thing that you can do is if you come back into this, let me make sure I'm in the right one. Yep. If I come back into this cloud code thread right here. Let me just tell it. Hey, thank you so much for going and grabbing that. I've actually gone ahead and added it into the form and the workflow is running. Can you go and double check in my NADN workflows to make sure that everything looks like it's running as it should? Please use a sub agent to do this because I see that your context window right here is at 73% already. And I want to try and protect your context window as much as we can. Please. Thank you. Cool. And once this part is done, we just have one more piece left to do. Which is good. So we'll be able to do this here. And we just need to customize sugar. Once this double checks, if we make sure it's at least running. Because.  \
Them: There's a whole bunch of questions related to where we are right now. Is it right if I ask? Because I've been trying to hold back, because I didn't. I wanted us to get through this, but it's related to the echo. Which is something. Oh, hang on, there's a bunch of them. So people were asking about, like, what goes in your. Your mega doc? Can we see your mega doc? Honestly, even if it's like a transcript of a coal or like certain social media emails or so or emails or whatever, like whatever you feel represents your voice. And then there is a couple questions around Sor I like. Don't you need a Gmail? No, this is where we got stuck before. We don't get the email. So that's like a.  \
Me: Yeah. So let's. Let's come back over here now. So if we go back to our. Our demo agent here, which we like. My. See, this is like. I even checked it right here. So when I told it to go check, I had errors on my workflows that we just ran right here, which is. Totally okay. And it's actually good because now we can show how. Do we have Claude go fix our API keys to our open router keys? So let's do that. So. But before we do, let's come back over here. So these are. Where did it go? This one demo processor. In here. When you. When Claude first sets this up. So this is the one that it set up brand new and fresh for me. When I am in here, there's going to be some things you're going to need to do, like the email node you're. You'll need to go in and set up. So Claude will either tell you to do that or if it fails and then it's trying to figure out why did it fail, eventually it's going to tell you. Hey, have you set up the Gmail thing yet? We're going to need to do that. So if I click on this. You could see that there was, like, a red thing on it. Or before there was. And if you've not set up a Gmail credential in here yet, we'll need to do one. So when you click on that Gmail node, you click create a new credential right here. And it's super easy here on Nadin to do this. So if I go, let me rename this, I'll call this like tnisk@gmail.com, just so it's a different email. I'm going to sign in. Literally, just, like, choose the Gmail account I want to sign in with. I'm going to allow the authorization from N8N into my that Gmail account. Then once it's done. There we go. Now it says it's connected. And so I can come in here and, like, if I have multiple accounts. So, like, this one right here is set up to my AI Build Lab account. This one's now my personal, like, kind of Gmail account that I've got. So I can have multiple Google credentials in here, and I just need to select the one that I want to use. So once I do that, And I back out that red little error message that was over. This is now gone because that's it needed us to go in and do our oauth on that to authorize it. And that's now happened. So there's that. The other part. Let's go back over here to Claude. And say, okay, thank you so much. I went ahead because when I went and looked at the workflow myself, I noticed that the Gmail needed to be set up and had my oauth connected to it, so I did that already. And, yeah, I see that we did not get the API keys flipped. As well. So I need you to walk me through exactly. How do we have this running on the exact clog model that we are running it on? Excuse me currently, but I want to use open router to do that. So can you go and spin up sub agents to fix any and everything that needs to be updated in the workflow for that to happen and then tell me where I need to go and add in my open router API key. And please make this as easy for me as possible so I. I won't mess this up. All right. Here we go. So I'm going to send that through. Let me grab this prompt here again. I'm going to try and do the extraction on all of this stuff. And send it after the fact. And some of these prompts are going to be, you know, specific to what I'm troubleshooting in mind that you may or may not encounter on yours. Okay, so got it. Let me spend up a subagent to update all the API calls to open router instead of directly to anthropic. So, yep, we're going to do that. So it is still using the anthropic Claude model. It's just going to be doing it through open router. To get around the rate limits like what we talked about. So like where if your API tier is not high enough yet to go directly through anthropic using open router is a really easy way to circumnavigate that issue. All right. I'm at a breather. Sorry. Are we caught up? We have other questions we can answer while we're waiting.  \
Them: We have a ton of questions.  \
Me: Okay? Yeah, go for it. Like, ask them while we're waiting for Claude to do its work too, and we'll. We'll knock them out as best as we can.  \
Them: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, guys, because the. The chat moves really quickly, and I don't know whether when. We're working. We've answered your question. So if you have anything that we haven't answered or that you're stuck on, just put it in the Q and A. Because, yeah, it's just moving really fast, obviously, so it's hard to. Ascertain whether your stuff's been resolved or not, okay? All right. I skipped over stacks. Since it wasn't working until today, which when it was pushed and Manual created a corpus, which I have an ID for, I went back to set up stacks and says I already have a corpus, so should I skip it? Which I don't want to do. How do I put stacks in instead of the corpus I created?  \
Me: Perfect. Yeah. So you can do both. Right. So go give all the information or explain it in plain language to Claude. And explain to it, hey, here's the corpus that we've already set up. Here's all the information about it. You can go and look that up and research it further. I want you to take that and make sure that it's merged into my. Stacks set up so that when I'm in there, I'll be able to see it and. And really, like you should anyway, because, like, when you. When you launch your. Let me get over here to it. When you launch your stacks, you'll have this little store selection up here at the top. And all this UI is doing is going and looking at the back end of your Google account. So when it loads your different Once you get stacks set up, it should just show up in here like the previous things that you've sent over to it. And if it's not for some reason, again, just tell Claude. And Claude will ensure that these two are are married and messed up correctly.  \
Them: While we're on stacks, Natalie is saying I'm having the same problem. Where is the URL for the stacks?  \
Me: So the URL. Claude will give that to you. It should be on. Let me grab this. It's just local host 3000. Let's if that port should generally be open on your computer, but if you. If you don't know, ask. And I just pasted it into the chat right here. If you don't know, ask Claude and tell it. Hey, I'm trying to go look at my stacks and I'm not seeing it. Can you make sure that it's properly configured and that I can open it up on a local host to run it, please? And it will do that.  \
Them: Okay. Anna's just asked when trying to make stack works. Stacks work. And trying to make the new store. It just gave me back this error. Failed N8 and webhook URL not configured. Can't go further from this point. Claude told me to ask the professors.  \
Me: Yeah. So most likely what you need to do is on the. The stacks settings right Here, there's this N8M webhook base URL right here. And this should be updated or replaced with something that Claude gave you. So even take a screenshot of this, like, literally, like, you can, you know, just this one section or the whole page of this. Go back over into Claude Code. And. If you hit the forward slash button, that brings up the menu. Or if you click, like right here, it brings up the menu. Click attach file. Go find that screenshot. Let me go find it. Here. Right here. It was. Boom. Go find that screenshot and tell it. Give it the error that you were running into. Like, you could do that in the same thread that you're already in. It's telling you that you're the error that you're running into. And just say, like, hey, I'm getting an error. When I'm trying to upload or delete something in the stacks and the activity log and it keeps telling me that it's not configured to the N8N webhook properly. Here's the screenshot to see what I see. Can you see if this is correct and tell me how to properly fix this and walk me through this step by step, please. So just like something like that.  \
Them: Yeah. I think it's like this is part of the new way of working. It's like when we. What we're used to, right? When we come up against an issue or an error, it's like we get frozen. But what we're trying to teach you here is to leverage cloud code to help you work like. Work through the. Like, work through the actual. Resolving the issue. So. It is a little bit different way to, like, just think through things. I know it's. It's a bit of a shift.  \
Me: Y. Eah, for sure. Okay, so right here, it's updated everything. And now here's your one simple step. Open your open router to get your API key. Cool. Open nan and go to the echo processor. Click on the configuration node. The first field is the open router API key. Replace it with our API key. So what I would need to do now. Is go over to open router. And we'll just, like, walk through this thing, beginning to end. If you not set up your account over here yet, you would need to, you know, do that. Put, like, five or ten dollars in here. You really don't need a ton of money. And then once you've added that money in, then you can go up here to the keys in the upper right hand corner. Click on that. Click, create a key. And I'm just going to call this MV mastery 12. What is today? Eighth 25 Test. Okay? Cool. I'm going to hit create. I'm going to copy this. I'm going to now come over here to the. N8n workflow. This is important. You need to back out of the workflow. I'm going to leave without saving, too, because I don't want to overwrite something that Claude did. So you need to back out of it and then come back into it. So I'm going to come back in here. And. Because of that, this gives us another option to go fix this, like, Gmail thing, which takes, like, two seconds. It's telling me to navigate. Let's see what it is. Say it said. Click on the configuration node near the top left of the canvas. Okay, so let's see here. Configuration node right here. So the left of the canvas. So I'm going to double click into this. And it's telling me replace with your open router API key right here. So I'm literally going to highlight this whole thing right here. And just paste in that thing I had on my clipboard. And I'm going to move back over here. So now that's fixed. And I'm also going to kill two birds with one stone. I'm going to click on my Gmail account right here. And I'm going to select the correct one. And. Now I'm going to hit save. All right. Cool. And it's an important thing to remember. And NA does not auto save. So after you make a change, you need to save it. So now if we go back over here and make sure we've done everything. So replace the API, key the node. Cool. All right. I'm just going to tell it. Hey. I have now done that. Can you double check my work and let me know if I'm good to go test, please? Thank you. All right, so I'm going to do that. And. While that's happening, let me go find. My. Mega dock again? Because I'll need that open again. And copy all this. Cool. So this is another thing you can do is like, as you're doing this stuff, if you're unsure. Sorry about that. If you're unsure about something, And you go do your part that Claude asks you to go do. Have it like QA or validate your own work. And it can go do that like it just went and checked the setup here to make sure that I did everything properly and is telling me now, hey, I'm good to go.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So this is, like, a really good way to, again, like, prompt your way out of being stuck and to ensure that you do things like the way that Claude's asking you to do it. That's how we do it. The. The joke is that. Let me. Pull this up. A lot of. A lot of people now joke and say, like, hey, we're basically like mouse monkeys. Like, we have to just go around and click and type on the keyboard and, like, put stuff where. Where these AI agents tell us to do. Like, we're a bridge in between sometimes what it feels. Like it's kind of a joke. We're the slowest part of the system. It feels like, too. Okay, so I'm. I've gone back into the echo workflow, part one. I've copied my. Oh no, I did that. I'm going to have to go back and get my brand doc again. I've copied my production URL. I'm going to go reopen. My. My page right here again in the same process. So I'm going to go like Tyler. I'm just going to do T and Fisk. Get Gmail. Cool. Personal my name. Writing samples. I go grab those again. That was up here. Megad. Oc. Yeah. So my mega doc, I think, has like, three different. Transcripts. And if I'm not mistaken, it's just what I grabbed to put in here for right now, which is more than enough. We'll even talk about this more on Wednesday and Friday. Because you could be like, hey, Tyler, sorry. Like, okay, I went and grabbed my own transcripts and emails, but obviously I don't work for Hattie B's. How the heck am I going to sound like I'm working for Hattie B's? That's when we get into observational Evals. It's like quality check and improving. Once we actually run these things, how do they do and how do we get them to be more towards our intended goal? That's what we're going to talk about more later this week. So here we have now made the updates. We've switched over to open router. We have rerun it. And now let's go have Claude double check us one more time. All right. Thank you. I've now updated the workflows and I have rerun them just as you've asked. And you go double check and make sure they're running this time without error, please. Thank you. All right. So now I'm just having it check to make sure that the innate end flows fired off like they should this time because last time that they had placeholder APIs and it did not work properly. Okay, so it's going to go look because it can go look at past and current. Running executions of NAN workflows, which is, again, it's awesome how much CLOCK can do on our behalf once we give it the right tools. Okay, so the workflow is failing with the provider error from anthropic APIs can be a few things. So it's going to think through this. So it looks like it did an update, but the open router still hitting an error. All right, cool.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: I mean, this is really all. This is stuff that you might see on your end, too, when you're doing it. So still hitting an error. Latest execution trigger here. 3 seconds open. Router credit quota limits. Dashboard. Oh, I bet I don't have enough. Likely causes. Okay, cool. All right, so, here, let me go double check this, too. And the way we can go validate this also is if we come back over to our workflow NAN and we click on it. Right up here in the top middle, there's editor, executions and evaluations. If we click on executions, You can see these past runs. So right here, it shows me it ran. And it got all the way up here to when it started doing the AI tasks, and that's where it failed. And that's what Claude just went and saw as well. So if I come back over here, let's see what Claude had to say. So, open router credits or quota? Open your open router dashboard. Make sure you have money in there, basically. Model access. Make sure that you have the correct model in there. And rate limiting. Well, we don't have rate limiting on there, so let's do this. All right, so I have money in my account. That shouldn't be the issue. And for the model, you have haiku 3.5 in there. Maybe we need to switch to the newest version of Haiku, so we don't have any issues with that, because I should have access to the existing model, but maybe that could be the issue, since it's definitely not the credit issue. So spin up subagents since you're getting low on context window to go suss out and find that out directly from open router on what is the correct model and how to call it. And then have another sub agent going and fix and update anything that needs to be done in our NAN workflow, please, so that we can try this again. Thank you. All right, cool. So now we have that, we're going to let the agents go, do some more work here. But at least it's like again, this could be things that you all run into. You might have set up your open router account and forget to deposit money in there. Or it could be that you need to go like they haven't unlocked your API account yet because you haven't set up your open router account all the way and accepted all their onboarding processes or something. And so Claude knows who this and is helping us think through and figure this out. And then we can have its agents go do things on our behalf again. All right, y'all. Sorry, again. While this is running, I'm trying to use the time in between here to answer questions and get back up to speed. You're on mute.  \
Them: Oh, I was saying, we do have a whole bunch of questions, but Rohan's had his hand raised. Yeah. So I don't know if Rohan wants to join us on stage. I just want to make sure that your digital arm is okay. So, Rohan, I've promoted you to panelists. If you would like to come on. He's declined Sarah and Tyler. So perhaps, Rohan, you can just type your question in if you don't want to come on camera. Okay?  \
Me: Yeah. No worries. Yeah, if you just want to drop that in, we're happy to help. Thanks.  \
Them: Do you want to While that is happening, do you want to help panda troubleshoot at Stacks Error? It's just in the.  \
Me: Yeah. Let's see here. Okay, so stacks error. I never get connecting Stacks error. Message. Failed to fetch. Fail to fetch. Haddie B's loading stores. Yeah, I'm thinking. So, Panda, have you gone ahead and given this message and a screenshot to the Claude code, your cloud code agent yet? Because that would be the next thing I would do because. It's either that. It could be a couple of different things. So what I would do is this. I would go back over to your stacks, set up right here. And I would screenshot the whole page as much as you might have to do multiple screenshots here. So screenshot the whole page. Screenshot the activity log. Open up the settings panel right here. And screenshot that. And then give all of that information, like attach all of those to a message and give it back the Claude code and explain to it, say, hey, here's what I'm saying. Here's the error that I'm running into. Can you walk me through and help troubleshoot and figure out what's going wrong with this and anything that you need to use in U Claud code can fix. Please go do that on my behalf and only tell me the things that I need to go fix from my end. So some version of that and I think that should work. Okay, So I see you have. Yeah. So this Nadin right here, this is going to be different for everyone. Like I even personally, I have a local host thing running right here, so if I take that off, And that is for me right now, because. We're really going to get in the weeds on this one for a second. But it should read something like whatever the name of my cloud native account is. Like what that webhook base URL looks like and paste that in. But because our personal Nadine cloud account that we bought instead of for this class. The webhooks are not firing properly. That's what we've been working with Naden's support team to try and get that figured out. Because it has to do with the server that they have our cloud account on. It's not functioning properly. And because we're trying to troubleshoot this as best as we can, I did a workaround that is a little bit more technical to make this thing function, to be able to show off in demo. So that's why this looks different for me than what it would look like for you all. But just as an example. Let me come back over here. And show it. Let me. Grab this error message and paste it in here. We'll pretend like this is mine. All right, so I'm doing this as a demo, live in class, to show how we would troubleshoot a problem like this. But I still want you to walk me through based on screenshot and what you're seeing here. Pretend like I'm a student setting this up, and I'm running into this error. And give me what would be the correct fix moving forward. I think it might be the N8N workflow or webhook, because that's what that looks like. The error message is saying. All right, so let's do that. Send this through. And. Let me make sure our other quads are still working over here in the background. Yeah. So that's what it was basically when it set up the calls to open router, it looks like it had the wrong address of what the model is referred to as, and it's gone in and fixed that. So it went and researched, figured out what was up. And then pointed it to the correct location. Okay, so what? This error tells us so. Got it. This is a classic fail to fetch error.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: When the front end can't reach your nan webhook. Let me walk you through troubleshooting this step by step. What this error tells us is the API key updated the Gemini API key saved locally, which is good. It's loading stores. It tried to call the NADN webhook. No stores were found. Creating a store. Tried to do via the webhook, but it's unreachable. The app saves your API key locally and then tried to talk to N8N to create and load stores, but it's not working. So the step by step fix is going to be to go to your N8N instance. Find the knowledge base, manager workflow or whichever flow handles stacks look for and toggle it on to make sure all of them are on. That's a big deal. That might be something else. Pandas to make sure you have them all the webhooks turned on and then we're going to verify that the webhook URL looks something like this. So let me grab this and we'll go back over to the stacks.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So that's where we would come here and paste this in. And it's going to be hopefully. Let me zoom in so you all can see this too. It looks something like this, or it's going to be HTTPs, whatever the name of your nan instance is called. And then the rest of this right here, it's going to look something like this for you. And Claude can tell you exactly what yours is. It's just not giving it for mine because I'm doing this as an example. And then if you try that, that should help. Get you down the right path to get this working properly. And if it's still not working, Panda, let me know. And we'll keep troubling or troubleshooting this thing till we get it fixed. Okay, cool. So now our other Claude has come back that we had working updating this stuff. It's now completed this. And it's been fixed. So the issue was the dots versus hyphens. Open router uses dots, not hyphens. The workflow is ready for testing. So it was a simple syntax error like that when it set this up, that it's now fixed and it should work as we hope. So if we go back to.  \
Them: You guys are learning to squash bugs using, like, hot code.  \
Me: Yeah. And honestly, this is part of what it's like in AI, like, just in general, not even just for this workflow, but just like, period. So getting good at this and getting comfortable with this, in this process of knowing that you might not have all the answers, things probably don't work on the first try there's not a lot of. It's not always easy to find answers for this stuff if you're just, like, doing this, like, Googling, like, an old way of doing it. Getting good at having the model research and help you debug and work through this stuff is a huge skill set. And mindset shift. Okay, cool. So let's come in here. We're going to do this one more time. Echo trigger. Let's see if we can get this thing to fire off successfully for us. Copy this. Paste this. In. All right, one more time. Here we go. Come on. Claw code. No whammies. All right, let's come back over here. I need to grab my megadoc again. Here it is. Mega dollar here. Boom. All right, cool. Copy. Paste this in. And. Let me make sure I'm deleting out just the right spot here at the bottom of mine. Right to there. Cool. All right, submit it. All right, let's come back over here. All right, Claude, no whammies. Can you go check? I've just triggered this again to run it after you've made all those updates. So let's see if we get it to run this time with no errors, please. Thank you. So we can have Claude check this, and then if just to show you all again. So we can go check it ourselves manually. If we go back over here to executions, this is the first flow. We can see that it's running. And then if we come back over here to the second workflow, We can see that it's running. Come on, baby. We won't be able to see it till it finishes, but the fact that it hasn't aired out at this stage is a good sign. And that's what it's going to come back and tell us as well. Because it takes a minute for this whole workflow to run because it's pretty big and there's multiple calls in it. So the fact that it's been running for 50 something seconds is a very good sign that it's doing what it's supposed to do. All right, so let's check in here. Cool. Yeah, so it's still checking, but it's only finding older executions. So I'm going to tell it differently. So it's been running for a minute, 20 seconds. All right, Claude, you don't have to keep looking right now because I can tell. I opened it up manually, and I'm looking at the executions, and in the actual flow that does the brand voice analyses, it's been running for over a minute now. So we must have done something right, and I think we're. Working, so we're just going to need to wait until the email shows up. Thank you. Cool. That way. I'm just, like, interrupting what Claude was going to look at here. So it quits trying to go check on its own here. Cool. All right. And so at this stage, it's going to take a second for this to run. Once it's done, it will emailed me that all the outputs from it.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: That's when I would take that back over to the stacks to add my brand voice analyses that I get in that email into that knowledge base. And then we take the brand voice snippet. Come over here to Claude and tell it. Hey, here's my personalized brand voice. Xml, I need you to help me update my sugar agent so it sounds more like me. And then, boom, we have ticked all of the boxes of week one homework. I'm going to stop my screen share. Now we can go into more on qa.  \
Them: Yeah. There's someone who. Someone who's additional hosts put their hand up if they want to come on stage. And, guys, if we haven't answered any of your questions, we'll get the Q and A. Download from Eliana. We'll get the chat download from Eliana, and if there's, like, unanswered questions, we'll send that out. So we'll make sure. Because there's been a ton of questions, but we just wanted to make sure that everybody is through part one and part two. Now, like, you know, we've been able to troubleshoot enough so that we can move on to the fun bit, really.  \
Me: Yeah. Of customizing, actually getting this thing to run. And then look at this system that you all have set up, beginning to end. It's a lot of moving parts here. So you all are. Give yourself some grace, because even in this way, it's still not an easy thing to do, like having the patience and the persistence to keep trucking onto this stuff. So, yeah, you all are doing awesome for sticking through with this.  \
Them: Oh, I think we lost someone who wanted to come on stage, so, yeah.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: Ileana's here. Rohan and J. Holdman. I see you have your hands up, but you declined to come on, so I'm gonna lower your hand. But if you do have a question, put it in the Q and A. And I see Barbara's hand going up. Would you like to promote her to. Yeah. I think so. If she's really stuck, we definitely want to help out. Thank you. So, Barbara, I'm promoting you. And Rohan and Holman. I'll lower your hand now.  \
Me: Sweet. Lee, I just saw your comment there. That's hilarious. Or Leah. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing your name incorrectly. But they said that when Claude says that this was hard when I was confirmation. I mean, it's true. Claude is probably one of the most empathetic AIs you're going to run into, so it gets it. Hey, barbara.  \
Them: Hi, guys. Frustrated. I have literally spent hours on the homework. And I thought. And every time Claude told me, there really is nothing you have to do anymore. You're great. You're doing great. And when I look at my workflows, they don't look like yours. You have that sort of huge thing in there. I don't. Have it.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: Then I think, okay, in the echo, the echo form I've really worked on, like, I have a restaurant. And so it was. So I'm so happy that we're doing a restaurant example. And so I put literally emails, all the complaint files that I've made. All the ideas that I have about hospitality. All the things that I've written about hospitality and put it all, and it's like a super clear voice. Facts. I asked my team, what are the 10 biggest questions? I mean, I've done it all. And I'm stuck.  \
Me: What part? Is the workflow not running at all right now or what?  \
Them: So. So the first, the first thing is if I open the echo form and then I have to put in the attentive, so I put in my email. And then. And then in the form pass, Claude told me I should put in my Palaba Echo form. And not use the normal pass, otherwise it's not gonna work.  \
Me: Okay? Are you okay with screen sharing so we can see what you're looking at? If not, that's also.  \
Them: Yeah, well, if you tell me how to do it.  \
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't know if Ilana needs to unlock anything or if she just needs to click share.  \
Them: You just need to click Share Barber. So at the bottom of your zoom screen, there's a green square in the right in the middle, and it's labeled Chair. Okay, Say that and get repeated again. So at the bottom screen, there should be a little green box with an arrow. Oh, yeah. I didn't have my window open enough. Okay. And so there you can share your entire screen or just the window that you'd like to us to see. Is it working? Share. Perfect. There you go. All right.  \
Me: We go. Sweet. Thank you.  \
Them: Thank you. Cool.  \
Me: Cool. On here? Can you so explain?  \
Them: So now I have to. Try and find you.  \
Me: What you're. Seeing on this. Now. Yeah.  \
Them: But okay, so by the authentication. I put in my. My email that I'm using. Correct.  \
Me: Yeah, but you do it on the front end, though, so not. Not here.  \
Them: Okay, so.  \
Me: So you're going to click.  \
Them: Should I just go first? Back to the canvas. Can you see that? All right. And so then here's the echo form where my.  \
Me: Okay? Can you. Oh, you're on email classification right there. So. Let's go to. Interesting. So click back out. Click on the home button in it in really quickly for me on the left hand side. Thank you. Okay. And then. Yeah. Interesting. So it pulled it all in. You have it somehow all set up in, like, one in the email classification deal. Okay. So can you do me one other favor? Can you pull open Claude code for me? In vs code. Sorry. There you go. And then just open a completely fresh Claude code chat right there. So the orange icon kind of like in the top middle. There you go. And then in that text box, can you just ask it to check the check GitHub. For the. For the latest student repo and see if I'm working on the latest version.  \
Them: Check GitHub. I think we recorded. Yeah, recorded your voice. Perfect.  \
Me: Here. We go. I love it. We do that a lot. And it never ceases to blow my mind of that.  \
Them: Crazy.  \
Me: We talked digitally through Zoom. You record it, transcribed it using AI and then sent it to another AI agent. It's wild.  \
Them: Living in the future already, Barbara.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Yeah, well, one step forward, three step backwards. Is it at a moment? It's okay. It's kind of like that. It's like a process. You get used. You get used to working.  \
Me: I love it. So what. What app are you using? Right there. Out of curiosity. For the. For the transcription part.  \
Them: Well, I'm not a technical person. I have no clue what you're asking me.  \
Me: Oh, okay. All right. Sorry. Like when you. When you held down a hot button to, like, record and convert the.  \
Them: Oh, whisper flow.  \
Me: I'll use a whisper flow. Sweet. Yeah, that's.  \
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  \
Me: Okay, cool.  \
Them: Well that one of you guys recommended it and I actually, my 87 year old mom is using it now, so that's really good.  \
Me: Nice.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: That's awesome.  \
Them: That's so awesome.  \
Me: Okay, so if you on Claude, it responded back here. So scroll up just a little bit. Let's see what it said at the very top of his message. All right. Sorry. Down just a little bit. Till it starts actually, like, typing back to us here. Right here. Okay, so, good news. All right? So latest available summer faces Echo workflow. Okay, cool. So scroll down a little bit. Since you're on your own custom branch. Here's what we're going to do. Stay on your branch or update the local main branch, okay? So I would tell it that you want to you need all of the updates pulled down and merged into your local branch of this, like your local version. And you also don't want to lose any of the work that you've already gotten done up to this point. And explain that you're trying to specifically run the echo workflow, which is now set up in two different stages in there. Which is like what we just walked through a minute ago. And it will go through and help you get that set up quickly and get it rolling. And I think once you do that, you'll be unblocked. So since you've already done, like, all the really extensive work of gathering all the things for the Mega Dock, like, once Claude finishes setting up this new update that. That you just pulled down right here, You should be able to work like it should get you cleared.  \
Them: All right, so let me. Got it there. So I did. I did try to do that, and I put it in the. In the questions. I tried to merge it. Let me see if I can find that back. Yeah. On this. In the. In the GitHub. I tried to merge it. Following cloth clots. Instructions. And then it said that at the bottom I should be able to see like merge and I couldn't. It's not there. And then it told me, well, write to just make a debug comment here. And then I said what I done and that I wanted to update the sugar agent prompt and this content only and ready to merge. If you're happy with the wording, could someone on the HD Vibes team review and merge? Thank you.  \
Me: Perfect. Yes. Yeah. So, like Claude had you do this, it should be able to do all that on your behalf.  \
Them: It does say no conflicts with the base branch. But then. There's no way. There's no button. To merge.  \
Me: Yeah, because I think it's trying to. Like, in this particular one, it was trying to get where you would merge back up.  \
Them: The cloud says that maybe it could do it. Allow dispatch comment. So if I go back to. Claude. Let me see what it says.  \
Me: Yeah, because you want to make sure that you're explicit in saying.  \
Them: Oh, it says merge successful.  \
Me: Successful. Yeah. You want to make sure that you're explicit in saying that you wanted to do it on your local version of the repo. If you said merge, Claude might have gotten confused and was thinking that you wanted to take the work that you had done on your local and push it back up to the cloud. To the public version of the repo, and that's, like, where it could have gotten. Confused in the past conversation, potentially.  \
Them: All right. So now it says that it will update upload both versions to NAN and 8N.  \
Me: Y. Ep. So. So now what you would want to do is not. Not everything that we did in the demo today, because I'm assuming that you already have a lot of that done, by the look of it.  \
Them: I. I did everything that was on the homework. I was, like, ready to finally follow and understand the lesson instead of literally tears down my eyes thinking I'm just too dumb to do this.  \
Me: I'm sorry. You're definitely not. I'm so sorry that you hit that blocker. Like, yeah. We're trying to make this stuff.  \
Them: I know. You guys are great. It's. It's. It's not by you. It's just really that every time I think, oh, I get that, and it makes sense, and then just the technical part, I get.  \
Me: Hung on. Yeah.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: It. I like, I feel you like. I. Honestly, I. I've had plenty of those days myself. And I'm trying to build and do something, and it just feels like a banging my head against the wall. Like this. This right here should solve the problem for us. So if you.  \
Them: So, Tyler in. In effect now. It just said quick checklist. So I should import these workflows to N8N and I'll do that together with Claude. But I. I have one question. Because the one workflow that you have that I think stems from Echo, and then it has this whole string of agents. Do we also have that? Should we be able to see it? Because.  \
Me: You do? That's what you just pulled down right here. So when it went and did this,  \
Them: Okay, so I just have to finish this step, and then I should be having that. Okay, well.  \
Me: Yeah. So now, if you like, have Claude do the work for you, have it.  \
Them: Yeah, exactly. I'll just ask step by step.  \
Me: Spin up. Yep. And have it ship it over there. And again, it might. You might need to. To have it troubleshoot some things. Like, remember I had to have mine switched over to open router, like when I did it here. So that it's not trying to call anthropic. You're going to need to have your, your Gmail, like going there and click on that and add in your authorization on that step. Once it gets into N8N and then you can go and run it. And. Even, like, what I was doing in the demo, like, tail clawed. Hey, I just ran it. Can you go check and see if it's running correctly or not? And. It will help you, like, along the way. It's just. Yeah, it just takes some persistence on this, so. All right. Pause. Here.  \
Them: Persistence is key. Thank you, Tyler. Thank you, Sarah. You guys are doing great.  \
Me: Thank you. Thank you. Well. I can't wait to hear on Wednesday. Once you get past this and get it crushed and if you like you or or anyone else like is like what we said or continuing to hit blockers.  \
Them: I hope we'll get there.  \
Me: Please use that Google form URL, because we're watching that, and that's a way for us to keep up and, and help troubleshoot this stuff with y'all asynchronously, on an individualized basis. Because you could run into, like, X number of different problems, and there's no reason for y'all to struggle alone. Like, just use that form and hit us up.  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Because I also know, like, that there are some questions in the chat, in the Q and A. We haven't got to yet. There's just been a lot. And we will make sure that we. We download those files and we'll get them from Ileana and make sure that your questions are answered for sure. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.  \
Me: Thank you, bara.  \
Them: Thanks, barbara.  \
Me: All. Right. Y'all. I. Know, Sara, I actually have to bounce here.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: In four minutes because I know I have a hard stop, but do we want to kind of, like, wind down for the day, or do you want to hang out?  \
Them: Yeah. I think so. Yeah, I think, Eliana, if you can pass us through the. The Q and A and the chat. And obviously the transcript or whatever that that way will send through what questions have not been answered as well as like Tyler said, if you guys use a Google form, we'll, we'll keep rolling in the. The answers for you.  \
Me: Y. Eah. Love. It. Thank you all so much for. For your patience and your grit to keep on with us. Like, it's. This is not easy stuff that you're doing. So don't. Don't trick yourself into thinking that it is. We are trying to make it as easy and accessible as possible. But I can't wait to see the. The y'all are going to be walking around with, like, confidence and swagger of, like, I can build whatever once I get past this. For this week. And, you know, these processes, too. So, like, zoom out for a minute. And, like, you're learning how to put this stuff together for, like, the specific workflow, but the process and how we're going out and doing some of this stuff, you're going to be able to learn how to do that for all sorts of different things after Friday. All right.  \
Them: Thank you so much to both of you. And again, on the last lesson, there's a quick guide for the part two of the homework, so go check that out as well. That's on lesson 33.  \
Me: Sweet.  \
Them: Yeah. And I'll make sure to get those resources to you guys. As soon as the transcript finishes processing, I'll get everything in a bundle to you with the questions as well. And for everybody here, I'm just going to share the form one more time. The question form, so you can continue to ask questions. To Saray and Tyler there as well.  \
Me: Questions as well.  \
Them: Yeah, Glen, you said it right. Hang in there. Change is never easy.  \
Me: It's not.  \
Them: But once you push through it, you guys are going to be amazed at how far you've come in the last few days, honestly.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: So persevere.  \
Me: Yeah. All right. Y'all.  \
Them: All right. Thank you.  \
Me: We'll talk soon. And we'll see you again. Same time, same place, on Wednesday.  \
Them: All right. See everybody on Wednesday. I have no more announcements, so good luck with everything and we'll see you guys on Wednesday. Thank you again, Sarah and Tyler. Thank you.  \
Me: All right. See you soon.  \
Them: Bye, everyone. }
