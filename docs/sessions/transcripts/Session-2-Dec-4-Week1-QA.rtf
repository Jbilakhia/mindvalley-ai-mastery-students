Transcript:\
 \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Perfect. Cool.  \
Them: Do you need help with the questions at all? Do you want me to have a look at the questions that came in and group them and ask them, or would you prefer to do that yourself? All done.  \
Me: Sorry, that's my computer talking. Yeah, we did it. So actually we went through have all the questions answered. We even have messages to send back to the students directly after the fact, with even prompts that they could chuck into their Claude code to help to teach them the meta lesson here of like you can use the tool to help you move forward.  \
Them: Yeah. And on that, we actually have a two guide. So it's like, how to prompt your way out of problems, like how to actually solve your own issues with cloud code. A guide for that. And a glossary of terms as well. Because, you know, it's a lot of new terminology. So I could send that to you now if you want to put it up, or could talk through it with the students as well. Yeah, we can do both. You can talk through it, if you like, to present the material so they know what it's about and then send it to me and I'll get it posted on the lesson as last eyes on Wednesday. Tyler, do you want to drive this? The screen share again, since you've got all of that. Like if we need to, instead of going backwards and forwards.  \
Me: Yeah. Let me get those files open here. One second. But, yes, I can do that.  \
Them: Okay, awesome.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: All right, guys, we're on time, so it looks like you have everything handled. If you do want to bring people up, just say, hila, can we bring this person up? And I'll promote them to panelists, and you'll be able to see in here, though. Perfect. But as last time, I'm going to go on stage. Now open the call. And when I call you both, then just go into the little door icon. Okay?  \
Me: All right. Thank you.  \
Them: All right. Thank you. People are coming in. Hello, Eloise. How are you done? So nice to see you again. Happy Friday. Dr. Rashan says. Hot. Yes, for me as well. It is super hot today. That's why I'm wearing this. It's very light. Super, super hot, but I love it.  \
Me: Super hard for.  \
Them: So Amandine says happy Friday. I love that name. Amandine, this beautiful name. And Dalene as well. I had never heard of that.  \
Me: You.  \
Them: Well, today, as you know, we're continuing on from Wednesday's jam packed with value class on Building Automations. But actually, before we begin, I want to acknowledge something really important. So I've been reading through your group posts and messages.  \
Me: But. Actually. Through. Your group post. Messages.  \
Them: And I can really see just how much effort so many of you have been putting into the homework, and I want to genuinely congratulate you.  \
Me: To the. Homework. And I want to. Introduce my. Congratulation.  \
Them: For your commitment to your own growth. This work is not easy. You're stretching into new tools, new logic, and also, as Sarah put it on Wednesday, new ways of thinking. But the value that you'll get out of it, as you guys know, both personally and professionally, is massive. But I still want to say congratulations. So much for showing up so fully and doing so much of the hard work. So congratulations to you. And with that said, as I said today, we will continue with that momentum. And we also have a special announcement coming in this session, which I will let Sarah and Tyler share directly with you. So please join me in welcoming Beck, Sarah Davison and Tyler Fisk. And a big thank you to both of you for the support resources you sent over for the students after last session. They were incredibly helpful guidance and welcome back. Recording in progress.  \
Me: S. So much. For showing up. Support. Ing. With that. Moment. Um. I will also. Hold a special. Announcement. Section. Which I. Will. So. Please join me. In welcoming. Tyler. Fisk. I. 'm a support. Over. To the students. I do. Incred. Ibly helpful. All right. Good morning. Y'all. Thank you so much. There. How's everybody doing? Happy Friday.  \
Them: Happy Friday Crew. I feel like we know you guys really well. I don't know. I just feel like we know you guys really well. We gelled the vibes are on, so I could see that the vibes continue, which is how we like to roll, too, so. Yeah. And again, thank you, everybody. Like, we can't really see what's happening behind the scenes, but. We know that you guys are so into this, and like I said before, just, like, really impressed with you all, because Tyler and I know that this is definitely growth territory, and you guys are definitely meeting, you know, the challenge where it is, but, I mean, what else do I expect? You're like mindvalley crew, so. That comes with the territory, right, Tyler?  \
Me: That's it. That's right. So I guess let's kick in with the announcement just to kind of, like, brief you all on everything. So basically we had the two loom videos that we talked about we're going to send over asynchronously. We filmed the first one and sent that over the second video. This is something. And it's like actually a good teachable moment here. Our personal we spun up a brand new N8N Cloud account just for this class. And our web hooks are not working properly on that. Of course. It's like we have technical difficulties as soon as we try and need it to teach to and that's like blocking us from getting our end of our workflows working on here. And so we've been in contact with N8N to get that fixed and solved. So the Loom 2 video is coming soon. And we're going to have a Monday session as well, so. Sorry, do you want to kind of, like, talk about that, to explain?  \
Them: Yeah. Okay, so this is something that you guys get used to. I don't know, Tyler. Like, I found, like, whenever we work with AI it's never AI that's a problem. It's like, the tech of the.  \
Me: It's always like a platform bug.  \
Them: Tech. It's always the platform thing. So. So it doesn't block you guys from actually progressing, because all of the information that you need to be progressing on your second homework is already in your workspace, or if you want to put it that way, and you can access it and maybe we can show you guys. How, but essentially, we're blocked from sending you the video, but the information is there, so you can continue on, like, actually progressing and you're not held back. But to clarify what's happening is, like, on. We realize also, and I think we just, like, love you guys and we want to hang out a little. Bit more.  \
Me: Yeah. Correct.  \
Them: So we're planning to see you guys again on. On Monday. And that is going to be another kind of session like this to help you guys get unblocked. Because we, like we said right at the beginning that we're committed to getting you guys to the finish line, and we know this is a lot, and we've had a little hiccup, and we want to make sure that you guys do get to the finish line. You're bringing so much energy and. We know that, like, you're putting. You know, it's not just, like, the financial investment. It's your time and your energy and your brain power that you're putting behind this, and it's super important for us. That we recognize that and meet you where you. Where you need to be. So this session today is going to be centered around. Excuse my email, but it's going to be centered around ensuring that you guys are all set up and you're ready to go. And we're also going to show you how to work with Claude to help you solve your problems in addition to achieving, like, going through the setup, making sure everybody's set up, and then progressing potentially to the demo. And if you won't have questions, we can bring you online as well, like on the panel. And I also have a couple more documents to send you guys. One is a glossary of terms. Because a lot of what we teach, and you might be poking around and seeing things, and we might have thrown around terms like shot prompts and temperature and stuff like that, which is really core to how we built all of this, that we are going to give you a glossary of terms so that whenever you come across something, and you're like, how did they do that? Or, what does this actually mean? And what are the agents again? It's just one place that you can access. And this will help you be on this course. Honestly, you know, just use it however you want. And then the second thing that we're also giving you. Is. We're. We're teaching you this new skill, okay? Because like I said, this is. We said, this is a completely new way of working. And I know this to be true because it's like your. Your number one instinct is to, like, go, oh, I can't figure this out. Let me email the. Instructors or, you know, or whatever, but we're going to teach you how to prompt your way out of problems. Because this is a completely different experience. You're going to be. I hate the word copilot. I hate. I really do. Like, I love the word copilot, but I wish it wasn't a Microsoft thing. Sorry if anyone works for Microsoft, but we're going to teach you how to prompt your way. Out of problems because you now have an incredibly powerful agentic system that has all the information that you need, that knows how to help you through things. And we just want to give you the way of, like, the framework of how you ask the right questions, or how do you actually work with an agent to help you solve a problem or to help you work through, like, the exercises or whatever. So, so we're going to share that with Ilana and that will be added. But we can, like, you know, we can touch on that today. We just want to make sure that we're also covering your, like, you know, what you need from us today to be able to feel like, you know, your. Your. You know, you're on it and you're ready to go.  \
Me: System.  \
Them: Tyler, is there anything I should Sarah Sara at AI build lab?  \
Me: No. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, no, this is. You covered everything. Great. Like, I've got two other things I'm going to drop here into the chat. So we had a bunch of questions come through in the form, so thank you all for using that. And we're going to get to those here in just a minute. And if y'all have other questions, too, please, Ilana, you can tell us if you want them to have them drop it into the chat or into the forum so that we can see those in addition to the ones that we've already gotten so that we can have people come up on stage and we can talk through that if y'all can't tell or if you haven't figured it out yet. Like, we're super casual, so if you're cool with coming on and we'll talk this out with you.  \
Them: If that's okay with you, Tyler and Sarah. Perhaps if you have any extra questions today, you can put it in the Q and A box. So we can stay organized that way.  \
Me: Okay? Perfect. All right. Thank you. All right. Y'all. So let's see here. The first prompt I wanted to drop in here for y'all. Let's see. Let me go ahead and grab that. Or actually, here, I'll do this here in a minute. I'll just talk to what they are and. And we'll drop them in and we'll follow up and send them in an email. Or I'll send them to Iliana as. Well, one of them is going to be some of the questions that we had were, were there's a bunch of different ways that you can pull down files from GitHub. So when you go and get our student information and then trying to get all that connected and synced up to your Claude code, That seems like it could be a stumbling block for folks. So what we've done is we have a prompt that you can give to Claude Code no matter where you're at. And because this is a publicly accessible repo, like, surprise, surprise, like, we can use AI to help us, like, prompt our way out of a problem right here. It can go out, grab that public repo, and clone it down. So basically, like, download it. But when it does it that way, it will actually sync it properly. So that, like, migrated to an area on your. Your computer so that it's in a good spot for it to be located. And then you can even have it. What's called commit. Basically, take your brand new personalized, private version of that. And put that into your own private folder in your GitHub account too. So this prompt will help you walk through that, because I know that's. That can be a bit of a pain in the butt sometimes. And then the other thing that we have because, like, we're going to help troubleshoot as much as we can here today and again on Monday. Also, we have an email and a message that we'll send out that will link you straight to a guide that will walk you through it. So I'll let me pull this up really quickly. And I will just, like, show you all what that looks like. So you're going to get all sorts of fun. Documents and guides from us, y'all. So here's what it is. The the email is going to link to this page. And all. Like I said, I'll drop. Oh, no. I hit the wrong button. There. We don't need to record a loom. Go away. Loom. No. Well, I'll deal with. That later. All right, so it's right here. So there's a homework guide right here. That's for the part two of the homework. That walks you through how to do that. And it even has some prompts in here. So Claude Code already has this, and this information is already in the repo. But because we understand. Repo was a word that might not be familiar to a lot of y'all. This might be your first time in GitHub. Like, navigating this might become, like, a real pain in the butt, and we don't want that to be an issue, so we're going to send you the link. To go straight to this document to walk through it to help you do your homework part two as well, while we're going to be putting together that that loom video part two for you also. So hopefully.  \
Them: Yeah. Do you mind also for just to keep an eye on Collapse your bar and expand your screen.  \
Me: This. Oh, yes, yes, sorry.  \
Them: Yeah. Tyler's going to drive again because he's got all of the screens and the docks and everything like that. Instead of us going backwards and forwards. And I'll play, like. What is it called? Like, the mc, is it?  \
Me: I'm pretty sure that sounds good.  \
Them: Okay, sure, whatever.  \
Me: Yeah. So there's the. I just dropped the link into the chat to this homework too. Kind of onboarding God for that part. Or like, I guess not onboarding like quick guide for how to do that portion of it. You want to make sure, though, before you do this that you have the latest version of the repository pulled down. So that's. That's one thing you want to make sure of. And that will be in the other prompts that I mentioned just a second ago that we'll be sending through. All right, y'all.  \
Them: Yeah, I just want to, like, I know that we have questions in Q and A, and I just also, just in case some people are in the same position as Barbara, Who didn't attend the last session and it is going like feeling overwhelmed. Where do I start? I would start with, like, logically, the setup. And the information that we gave for that first homework. You can watch the video and everything. I think it's helpful. It is long. I'm going to warn you, so you might want to, like, grab a coffee and some lunch or whatever and, like, watch through. It's more of, like, the. The introduction to it. But the actual doing there is a guide or step by step process free to follow. So definitely Barbara and everybody who missed it do the setup first. You cannot do part two of the homework until you've done part one, obviously. And then. Yeah, and then take your time. And that's the reason why we also do have the Monday session, the bonus session on the Monday. So that we understand people have lives outside of Sara and Tyler. Like, what do you guys do in your spare time? And so, like, you know, that session is also there to help you catch up. So don't like stress too much. Just try your best to catch up over the weekend. As much as possible. And if you're still stuck, there's some Monday session before we get into, like, essentially the second part of what we're teaching on Wednesday.  \
Me: Perfect.  \
Them: All right.  \
Me: You know, I went ahead and I dropped the link. I'm sorry. The prompt in the chat here in Zoom that you can give to your clawed code that will help you clone down or ensure that you have the latest version of the repository or GitHub repo. And we'll. We'll send that after the class too. So for anyone that's not in class or I know Zoom Chat will go bonkers here, and it's going to get scrolled up here soon, so we'll make sure we follow up with that as well.  \
Them: Tyler is the best way to do this is like, there's a bunch of questions in Q and A. And I guess, Eliana, if people want to come, like, onto the. On stage, do they just put their hand up? Is that how it works? Is that how they indicate?  \
Me: Y. Eah.  \
Them: Yeah, sure.  \
Me: Go ahead. Sorry.  \
Them: Thank you. So if there's a question from somebody that you would like them to clarify or to you would like to bring them up, just let me know what the name of that person asking the question is. And then with the name, I can bring them up as Palinola. So, yeah, I just need you to let me know the name of the person, okay?  \
Me: Sweet. Yeah. So. So, Joffrey and Eloise, we saw that you all submitted some questions, so if you would like to, you can go ahead and, like, signal in the chat that you're good with coming on camera if you're not, totally fine. Also, I'll say that everyone who submitted a question there, if we, if we know who you were, there was a couple, I think, anonymous ones. Totally cool, but we've. We've done written answers to your questions, and surprise, surprise, we even have prompts written for you to give back to your Claude agent to help you asynchronously, like, after class, as well, with your questions, so.  \
Them: So Joffrey is good to come on stage, it looks like.  \
Me: Awesome.  \
Them: Yeah. And eloise.  \
Me: And Ellery said, too. Yeah, cool. For you. Nice to meet you. Good morning.  \
Them: Gets to meet you now. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Good evening. I don't know what time is on your side, but it's late on my.  \
Me: Well, thanks.  \
Them: Thank you.  \
Me: For having there with us. Yeah, I know that you had submitted, like, a few different questions around GitHub nadn, like, a little bit of everything. So you just kind of want to, like, brain dump back to us and we'll. We'll help you out.  \
Them: Okay? So I'm not sure if I was too far in the homework, if it was on work part two or part one. Something that I was not really clear is about the GitHub. It was not really clear for me that we needed our own account on GitHub, you know, in the seven steps. So I personally created one. When I was watching the replay, so maybe it's useful for everyone. And I figured out that part because when I typed the commits that you shown us, Claude co told me, but I can't commit it. It's on your local computer. You don't have a GitHub on the cloud. So this is where I was confused. So what I did is I created my own GitHub because it's brand new for me, and then cl, I mean. It's pretty easy, actually. Like the way you teach us to ask. AI. Now, for everyone in the WhatsApp group with me, I was kind of stressed out. I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing. So I was doing things. It was working, but I was kind of sharing my feelings. At the same time, but. So the way we did in the group is we ask so the GitHub maybe for everyone. We need an account.  \
Me: You do?  \
Them: That was not clear. Now, there is another question, so I don't know if it's. I kind of answered the question myself. If you want to add anything that I'm not covering.  \
Me: Yeah. No, you did it perfectly. So, yes, you did a GitHub account.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: In the the loom video that we did record and send over to y'all. Check that out because it walks you through step by step. How do you do the onboarding for the first part of the homework? So you'll need GitHub. You're going to need some API keys. You're going to need your N8N account. You might need to set up or you will need to set up the GitHub CLI. So GitHub CLI is like command line interface that basically gives Claude the ability to take actions on your behalf with your GitHub account. So that video, like, walks through the process of how to get that up and rolling also.  \
Them: So we're on the GitHub quest. Like territory. Jans asking what is actually GitHub?  \
Me: I mean.  \
Them: Yeah. Because I think it's important for people to know. Yeah.  \
Me: Yeah. I mean, it's. It's basically, you could think of it as a more complicated version of something like Google Drive or. Or Microsoft OneDrive or something like that. It's where you can. Push up your code or documents or things like that, and in either a public or a private way. And it's also kind of like a very nerdy kind of social media platform in some ways, too. Like, people use it as that. But that's. That's the kind of short version of what it is.  \
Them: Yeah. So, John, to explain. Yeah. Like Tyler saying, it's kind of think of it like a Google Drive for, like, tech stuff, mostly like that people like to work with. And so when we talk about repo. It's kind of like that is a folder or something like that within Shared Drive, if you. If you want to think about it that way. So GitHub repo. That's like, kind of think about it as Google Drive, but for, you know, Geeks. I don't know. And, like, you know, folders and stuff like that. So that's probably the easiest analogy.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: All right.  \
Them: So.  \
Me: Yeah, Jeffrey, we'll let you go back to. To driving here now.  \
Them: No. Yeah. Sorry about. Sorry. So GitHub, I think is pretty clear. Thank you for the N8N. I did not get so far in the homework, but because I was trying to move forward to prepare today. Do we need an API in our VS code? Because what I understood, Tyler, is that it was about the language, semantics. Or maybe it's my English. I don't know that you push something into NA10. But then I ask Claude code again, and he told me, okay, you have two ways. First one is to upload. From your hard drive. So from the repo, basically 2 and 8 and manually. Second one is to set up an API. Which was not really from my code code on my computer, but it was not really advised because of security reason or whatever. So what I did is I uploaded myself the Echo ETOs. Yeah, Echo Workflow. And my question is, so my first question is, do we need the API? So we push it directly from VS code and for me, it's kind of addictive to us, just cloud code to do it. So I would like to you to confirm. And the second question is, I noticed because I uploaded manually that the nodes are not exactly the same that the one we presented Wednesday on your screen. You had a lot of nodes for, you know, the psychological whatever of the semantic and the one I uploaded from my repo.  \
Me: Lost sound. Can y'all hear? I can't hear anymore. Oh, could you hear? So.  \
Them: Oh. No. Jeffrey just went silent for a second.  \
Me: There we go. Now I can hear you.  \
Them: Am I back? So did you hear what part you didn't hear? I'm sorry.  \
Me: No. No. I followed you all the way. So basically, you have your N8 account set up, you have the repo pulled down.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: You got to the point of trying to determine. Can you have Claude code? Give it the API key from NADN to go do work on your behalf. Or do you do it manually? Is that kind of like. I think that's where we were at.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: That's the first question? Yeah, first question. And the second question was your. Your echo workflow looks different than the one was that Tyler was demoing.  \
Me: Y. Eah.  \
Them: Yeah, in the screen the echo is from Europo that I cloned, but. But did it change? Because I understand there is an update, so maybe I'm too fast, but I don't want to confuse everyone in. In the chat, because I can see in the chat that maybe we're too far from the lesson. And please, if I'm too ahead, I understand that it's. It's to.  \
Me: You're perfect. Like, we SAR now always say that we attract a lot of, like, high D drivers that want to get in here and get to work and get stuff done, so I love it. So let's. Let's talk about this. Let's walk through what exactly you just were kind of laying out for everyone so everyone else can follow along here. All right, can you all see my N8N account right now? Yes. Okay, cool. So I am in my n8n cloud account.  \
Them: Yes. Yes.  \
Me: And when you first set this up, you're not going to have, you know, if it's a brand new account, obviously it's going to be empty. Right? So what you can do, there's a couple of different ways that you can get your information from the student GitHub repository, which is where we're giving you all of the resources. Some of those resources are these NAD workflows. And to get those up here into your account. The main way. Is that you can go create workflow. And up here in the upper right hand corner on these three dots, you click on that. And you can go import from file. You click on this? Then you would navigate to your folder, wherever it is that you might have the. The actual repository that got downloaded. And then you're going to come in here and look into workflows. And in the workflows, this is where you can come in and select one and pull it in. So I'm just going to click this one. It's going to be what's called a JSON file. And if you click that and pull it in, Then it will. This was actually, like, a tester one. So let me. That was kind of a junkie one to pull in. Let's pull in a different one here. Import from file. Let's do. Let me look at this. Is this a better one? Let me pull in this one. There we go. That looks like we're doing something a little bit more here. When you pull this in, it should pull in in this way. Now what you can do. Is like, you can give this a Claude code, and it will check and make sure you're fully up to date. And, in fact, my file that I pulled it from, I think is pulling it from an old one. So this is like a manual way of doing this. I don't want to save this, so let me go in here and. Actually let me just, like, back out. It's. It's basically a manual import, is what you would be doing if you go about it this way. The other way that you can do this. And there is a good cloud code is correct and it's very. It will tell you it's prudent about security. So you don't want to put things like API keys necessarily directly in the chat. For cloud code, for any sort of tools that you have, because if you do that, It's stored. And it's like putting your password somewhere it is in a secure environment, but there's the possibility that it could get exposed somewhere down the line, and we don't want that. And Claude will tell you that. Like I just did to Joffrey when he was trying it. So what? You can do is you can do a couple of different things. If you come into again in my innate and account. Down here on the bottom left is my name and I click on Settings. And it says right here on the left hand nav bar nan API, if you click on that. You'll see. I have an API key right here. You could do a few different things. The easy route, and I would suggest this is to go create an API key. We're going to call it just like. Temp key. Let's just do that. Right here. You can set an expiration date. So you can set it so that this password is only valid or only work basically for X number of days. Or you could set it to no expiration. This is good, but just if you put an expiration date on that, try and like maybe set a calendar reminder or something so that you don't forget, because you might come in here and try and have Claude code do something. He's like, I can't do it. API key is not working. So I'm going to set this one as 30 days. I'm going to click save. That gives me an API key now. I'm going to now click on this copy button, because as soon as I close this out, I won't be able to see this key anymore. It's. It's basically going to be. It's going to be gone. Or, like, hidden, basically. So now that I have that, if I go over in a cloud code and let's come over here into just, like, a fresh thread. I'm going to do this as a placeholder. Hey, Claude. I need your help. I'm wanting to give you the capability to help me, to help me manage my innate in account completely. And I know that you're able to do that via the. If I give you API access to it. I have currently made a temporary API key that I'm going to give you so that you can get all of this set up. But I know that there's going to be a more secure way to do that where I can delete this key once you've done this initial setup and replace it in a. In a special way. And can you explain that to me, how that would work and, like, do this setup and walk me through this? End to end, please. Thank you. All right. So, like, again, I'm talking to this on purpose, like, very casually, and I'm trying to explain it. As best as I could. This. What I'm doing right now, I'm pasting in this API key. Is. What I'm saying is you don't want to do this and then leave this as the only API key. Because when I'm done, I'm going to go delete this one. Or it's called revoking it. It'll make this no longer a valid key once Claude does the full setup. And since I'm telling it that, also, it might not be as, like, stringent with me as, like, what it did for you, Joffrey. Like, no, no, no, that's not secure. Don't do that. Which is correct. But this is like, a temporary little workaround for us. So does this. Is this making sense so far, Joffrey?  \
Them: Absolutely. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.  \
Me: Okay? Yeah, for sure. Okay. It's looking to do this. It's asking to run a check right here. So I'm going to hit. Yes. And then allow the glob search. It even might ask you to set up. We have some MCPs called out in the repository as well. Again. I'll try and, like, pause and explain any. Acronyms or tech Pro language that we say. So MCP is Model Context Protocol is what that stands for. And that is basically a tool that you can give to an agent, like Claude code. And is a part of the onboarding process. When you're connecting to nan, Claude should ask you to set up the NAN mcps if it's following all of our onboarding correctly. If it doesn't, that's okay. When we get to this stage, it's going to realize that it probably needs to. And we'll ask that when it's walking you through stuff. So in here. It's telling me now I have the full picture. We have Claude code and actually, I need to come in here. Hey, Claude. I'm actually doing this as a live demonstration in the office hour session for Mindvalley right now to show the students how we could go through this process of giving them the temporary API key from N8N. To have you set this up so that you're able to go back and forth. With it. And do work on our behalf for the student's behalf in Nan. So just keep that in mind. Please don't make any changes on my setup because we already have all that rolling, but just continue to walk through this process. So that it simulates what the students will see when they do this as well. All right. Sorry. All I needed to do that so I didn't break something in my own settings in here. But basically what's going to happen is it's going to set all the parts and pieces up. And then put in that temporary API key. And then once it's all done with that, it should tell you, hey, I have this working. I've tested it. Now you need to go in and replace the existing API key in this file, and it'll tell you exactly where to go. Do this with a new one that you generate. And so when you get to that stage, that's when I would come back over here into innate end to this temporary key that I made. I would make another one, and we'll call this, like, innate in office hours Live. And go ahead and hit save on this one. It gives me this new key. I'm going to delete both of these also, like, after class. Because anytime you expose a key, it's like exposing a password, right? I would take this one, I would come to that temporary one, and we would delete it. Let me get over here to it. Delete it right here. Delete forever. And now we've removed that password, so we're now secure. We only did this as, like, a contemporary stop gap, and we would take this new one that we just made, that's going to be the actual key we're going to use, and we're going to go copy and paste it manually where Claude Code is telling us to do it instead of giving it back. To Claude. So, to be clear, I'm going to recap this again. You're going to ask Claude to help you set up and to install the tools that it knows to do so that it can use the N8N API. To do actions in N8 in on your behalf, and you're going to give it a temporary API key that you create and give to clock code directly in the chat for the first time. Once it gets everything set up and it tells you where that is and where to go, replace it with the new key. That's when you're going to go generate the new API key. Delete the temporary one and manually paste in and replace that in the file that Claude is telling you to do it in. So hopefully that's like. I know that's like multiple steps here, but hopefully that's makes sense and is clear. All right, Let me go delete this too, before I forget it, because I'll forget. And there we go. All right, cool.  \
Them: Tyler.  \
Me: Yes.  \
Them: You just went silent after you said manually something. I think. I think it's like something to do with the. Since it's happened to several times, I think it's something to do with.  \
Me: I can select zoom because. Yeah, I'm not hitting anything. It just was like, doing that. Yeah. So what did you hear? And I'll try and recap.  \
Them: I. Just heard when you went and manually and then you dropped.  \
Me: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Okay. I'll do one more quick recap. I'm sorry, y'all. You're going to get to hear me, like, repeat this. You're going to be saying this in your sleep tonight. Yes. We're going to copy an N8N key. We're going to put it in here. All right, so we're going to go and generate a temporary N8N API key. Like you saw me go navigate and do. We're going to give that to Claude Code. And Claude Code is going to help us set up the tools and connections that it needs to be able to take action in our innate N account on our behalf. And then we're going to intellid that. And tell it that we're going to replace it with a fresh key. And once it gets everything set up, you can even ask it to tell you. Where do I need to go to go replace that. It'll give you the file link. You're going to go to that file, and that's where you're going to manually delete the temporary key, like, get rid of it. Make the new key and replace it in that file. That's what I'm saying you're going to manually do, because any live key that you're ever going to use, this is something you all can do in the future. For any other API setup that you want to do, you can temporarily generate a key. Give it to Claude, code, have it do all the setup work. Tell it that it's just for a moment and then go back and replace it later with the live key. And do not give the live key back to Claude. If it does, it will tell you. It'll slap you on the wrist. Oh, you just. Gave me the key again. Like, delete that one, too, and go make another one. And here's where you need to go do it. It's very empathetic and infinitely patient, so it'll walk you through this if you just keep asking it questions. Cool. All right. Joffrey, do you have other questions on this? To.  \
Them: Thank you so much. No, no, you're brilliant. We're spoiled to have you. Thank you so much. I leave the room for the other questions. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Tyler.  \
Me: Thank you. Thank you.  \
Them: Oh, and it's totally normal to be having feelings while you're doing this, because it is. It is wild. Like, you guys are learning something incredible and, like. So like, it feels sci fi. So, like, uncomfortable. Uncomfortable to let go the control, but we're getting there. Thank you.  \
Me: Yeah, absolutely. And it should do this automatically. But it's always good. Anytime that you're using cloud code to take actions on your behalf. Have it come back and explain what it did. Ask it clarifying questions. If you don't understand or you want to learn of. Why did you do this? It's a great learning path. To do. Not even just for this, but just in general for anything that you're doing with AI that feels like is stretching beyond your own capabilities. That's how I've even been teaching myself to code more over the last year. Plus because like I said, I would still consider myself non technical compared to a full stack developer. Yeah. Cool. All right. Eloise, how are you doing?  \
Them: Well, good. Thank you. That's encouraging. If a year and a half from now we're going to be like you, I think there's a group of us that's going to be very excited. So thank you for. For calling me up. I did have a few questions. Now, I can't actually remember all of the questions because I think we sent you a few of them. One of them, maybe will be quick. I know I started to do the onboarding by using the prompts before they were taken down, so. I had a zip file, and when I actually put it in my repo, it actually named the file as MindValley AI mastery student main, which doesn't seem to be the same name as what you have in your repo. Yours doesn't seem to have Main. So I'm thinking, do I have the same files as you have, or is it a different file? Am I using the right documents?  \
Me: In fact, let's just go do it here really quickly. So let me grab. This prompt just so we can walk through this process for everyone. If you all can't tell, I'm a kinetic learner. So for me, seeing it, doing it. Learning through the process of getting it wrong. I didn't get it wrong. I'm just learning the right way. Or a bunch of different ways to not do it, I guess. Best way to put it. So I'm going to paste in that prompt that I put in chat and that will send after in a follow up email. Too. That's saying help me get the latest course materials, clone or update the mind Valley AI Mastery student and it gives the URL right here and if I already have a copy, pull the latest changes. If I downloaded a zip or don't have a get set up clone fresh from my home folder, show me where the files end up. Okay, so this is set up in a way. So that's what I'm saying. There's more than one way to skin this cat. You can download it, you could clone it manually. If you went that way, you could have Claude come pull it down.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: And Claude can even rename it for you, too, if it wanted to, which is what it sounded like it did.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: That's not necessarily. Excuse me. It's not necessarily changing the files. It's just like making the repository name unique to you. And honestly, once you have it pulled down, you can name it whatever you want to because it's a complete disconnected copy of what is on live on the public version. Basically, it's like you've cloned it, is what happened. So I'm going to put this in here, and I'm also going to put a little caveat because this is on my computer and I have a bunch of different versions of this already. So I need to clarify just for my end. Hey, Claude. I'm doing this as a training, a teachable moment. Live in the office hour session here on mindvalley on Friday. So I need you to go ahead and do this, but pull this fresh clone down as an example in a brand new folder and name it as such so that I'll know that it's different. Because as you know and as you'll see, I already have existing copies of this repository on this local machine, and we need to write it in a way so it's distinguishable to know which one this is. Please. Thank you. Okay? Yeah, so you don't have to do this latter part. I just did that because of my stuff on my end. So once I pasted in prompt this initial one like what you all would do. It's going to ask to do a bash command that's basically asking to run a code command within the terminal on our behalf for us, which is what it's going to go do.  \
Them: Tyler, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you did go silent again, and we've been talking. Yeah. And I just, like, I just want to make sure everybody had the full context.  \
Me: Oh, Lord. I'm like, screaming.  \
Them: Always. Where did he finish before? No, I was the same. And the screen just went and just wrapped. So I was like, okay, let's. I was trying to be polite and not ask, but yep.  \
Me: You have my full permission to interrupt me anytime.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Sorry. I didn't know. I don't know what's going on with that. That's odd. So yeah. I was brain dumping for a minute to clog a little bit extra on my prompt up here. Because I already have this repository and the developer version of it and all that stuff on my computer. So y'all will just put this prompt that we put in the chat and we'll send in the email as well. That's what you're going to put into your Claude code. And it will either go and pull down the latest copy of it for you and update it, or it will see if you have the latest copy and get it all set up for you on your computer. So that's what mine is going to be doing right now. I just had to tell it a little bit differently right here. That, hey, you're going to see that I'm teaching this live in class. Already have this, so set it up as, like, a third copy or fourth copy on my computer.  \
Them: Tyler. Someone suggesting that whenever you go silent, I should dance or, like, wave my arms or something? Is that. No, seriously, I will, because I think we lose half the context. Is that. Will that be helpful? Because I think that's going to happen a lot because it's happened a few times.  \
Me: Yeah. You need to do, like, the Billy Bounce or something, like, whenever you do it. What moves do you know?  \
Them: I'll stick to my day job, let's put it that way.  \
Me: Yeah, that's cool. So now here we go. And it doesn't take it very long. So now it's got a fresh clone pulled down.  \
Them: Sorry.  \
Me: And I'm in VS code right now. In Claude code, so, like, I didn't preface that either. And it's telling me, hey, I just pulled it down. Here's the latest version. It even updated the name for me. But because it's cloned it now. What we can do is I can come up here because this would probably be empty for y'all in VS code because you've not opened this folder before. So what I'm going to do then is I'm going to go. It's telling me it's on the desktop. So let me go file. Open that folder. And I'm going to go navigate to where it tells me that it is. So it's right here. And I'm going to click open. And you say, yes, I trust the authors. Because that's like it's talking about us there. And then now we have the latest version of the repo, and it's actually connected to it in the sense of it knows where it came from. So now, anytime in the future, if we tell you all in the coming days or weeks, like, hey, guess what? We push another update to the repository for like improvements or more prompts or whatever it might be that we add into there for you all. And this is what you can go do to go check and see that you have the latest version. You can open up Claude code and say, hey Claude, I need you to go and check on this repo that I have. Is it the latest version or have there been any new updates in GitHub that I should sync up and pull back down. So I have locally here as well. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Yes.  \
Them: Okay. Now you're back. Now you're back.  \
Me: There we go. Sorry.  \
Them: We were. All frozen.  \
Me: I think I figured out what it is. It's like anytime I'm using Mac Whisper, Sara. It's like killing my mic or something, is what it's doing. Yeah. Okay, so it's like instead of me typing, I just told it. Hey, Claude, I need you to go and check on this repo that I have. Is it the latest version, or have there been any new updates in GitHub that I should sync up and pull back down so I have them locally as well.  \
Them: Right.  \
Me: So it just did this. So it should go. Check it and tell me. No, you have the latest version, so let's just see here.  \
Them: While it's doing, I have a related question saying I was 90% complete. Complete only original instructions. Now the instructions have changed. All done. And the repository changed. How am I supposed to align all those things? Do I lose my hours of work and start again? Sad face.  \
Me: No, you haven't lost anything. So when you pull down a new repo, What's the best way to put it? Without. You can pull down the new files in addition to what you have. Ask Claude what is new about that? And tell it even like the work that you've already done and see how you might want to change your make that update and which is a good call out because we did make an update to the Echo workflow. And so this is a way that you can take your existing work and merge that over, and I'll go show you all that here in just a second as well. So right here, by running that prompt that we did just a minute ago, it pulled down the fresh version of the repos. That's a good step one. I've now opened that folder over here. And then now that I'm asked it to go back and check and anytime in the future, if you ever want to go see if we've ever pushed new updates in there, this is a way you can go and ask Claude to go and check in the cloud to see if there's anything new there. Basically. Same thing. If you have it, do what's called commit. Let me do that now, and then I'll go show you the new stuff on the echo thing here in a moment. All right. Claude, I need you to go set up a brand new private repository for me that I can also push this up to. So I want to be able to be able to pull down and understand and stay in sync. If Tyler and Sara ever. Push any updates to the original student repository, but I also want to have my personal private version of the repository in my GitHub account too. I don't have that set up yet. Can you go and do that for me, please? Thank you. Okay? So hopefully that makes sense. It's kind of like, if you want to imagine, like a V, right here at this point is the public repository that we've shared with y'all. You've pulled it down to the bottom of the V, and that's where it's, like, storing it locally and we've asked it to both remember where it got it from originally. Over here. Pull it down locally. And now go make a new third point. Over here on this side of the V. That is a private GitHub file store of this for me in that third node. So hopefully that makes sense. That's what it's going to go set up. It's telling me that it's logged in as a D vibes. Depending on if you have done all of the other onboarding steps yet or not, it might tell you like, hey, I need you to go do this so I can take actions on your behalf and GitHub so if I have so it's like doing that on my behalf right now. But if you haven't, it will walk you through that process. Or you can ask it to walk you through that process.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Cool. There we go. And so now I have successfully pulled down the latest version. Of the student repo, which is upstream, and it's explaining it to me. I've also made a new copy in the Cloud for me of my own private version as well. So any changes that you make when you go in and add your brand, voice analyses, or any updates to your prompts that are personalized to you, it's not going to sync that back to the student repository, it's going to sync that back to your new version of it instead. So hopefully this all is clear. Elois, is this making sense or connecting the dots on this?  \
Them: It's making total sense. I think the only one additional question to this I would have is in the video or the replay you had on that left hand panel, the third icon, it would show up with sometimes a little like number two, number 65, or how many changes you would have. You don't have it. Now on your screen. Now, it kind of alluded to the fact that you had to actually make a command and say, Please commit to GitHub. Is there not a way, like to auto save? Is there not an auto save on this, on the system? Or do we have to remember, like right now, if we make a change. Is it not going to do it automatically? Or we really need to get into the mindset of constantly saying if we make a change, put our brand information into our own repo in order to send it to GitHub, is it not going to send it automatically?  \
Me: All excellent questions. So the short answer is no, it will not automatically send it to the cloud in GitHub and that. 's by design. Because what you're talking about is right here in this little branch.  \
Them: Exactly. Yeah.  \
Me: That is where it will if we put a new file in here. So if I come over here and just let me go here, I'll just make a new page and we'll call this like Tyler. Test MD and I'm going to go, like, test. I can't type. Let me go with test and then I'm going to save this. Now we see there's a one right here. So what is this signaling is? I have one file on my local GitHub repository. It saved it on my local computer but it has not synced it to my cloud account yet. You're not losing your work. You still have it. But if you want to push it to the cloud, then yes, you have to either commit it manually or ask Claude to do it on your behalf. And there's reasons for this, right? Like there's sometimes that you might not want to push things to the cloud. You might want to keep some things local only and other things like syncing back and forth. And you can do that in here. So let's say that I'll give you a for instance, I have a completely different repository that I have set up with a bunch of AI agents that help me do personal accounting, like for my own finances. And in there I have a lot of private documents of, like, bank statements and credit cards and receipts and stuff. And I need that in the repository locally for my agents to see it and help me do work in there. But I don't want to sync that up to GitHub because then it is secure. But there's a chance that it could get leaked to breach and I don't need all that out in the open. So that's where I'm saying. If you ever have files that are local but not in the cloud. That's what it's signifying here, that, like, there's a discrepancy there. It could be on purpose, but it also could not be.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: So again, this is like even asking Claude. To help you with that. It can help set up something called the git ignore. And you don't have to know what this is. It can explain it to you. It's basically telling you to anytime I do a future commit, always ignore these files so that it keeps them local and it doesn't sink them to the cloud, basically.  \
Them: I did have a lot of other questions that I think will come in part two. So the echo. I can leave, I think, for later, maybe. Can you teach us how to have Claude Clark code tell us that it's done? That little is done. I don't know if that's easy.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Yes, for sure. I'll do that. And I'll even.  \
Them: I mean, if. If people want to hear. If not, we can leave it for some. I could try to figure it out. And can we save our chats or can we save our conversations? And CLAUD co Because at some point, I don't know, something froze and I had to come back and I had lost all of the chain. And I thought, oh, sugar, how do I go back and figure out where I was, what I was doing? And I would love to be able to save. So I've left a few of them open, going, I just don't want this to crash at some point.  \
Me: Yeah. No. Good. Great question. Okay, so, like, right here, anytime you open up a new Claude code window or you're on an existing chat, I'll do it in both. So in an existing chat, there's a little kind of drop down right here that looks hidden. So because this is a brand new conversation. There's no other information here.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: But if I'm on a brand new.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Chat open a new window. If I want to go back and find my historical chats within this repository, I can click here and I'll see them. So if I go, let me come over here to a different.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Bear with me. One second here. So let me go. Open folder. Let me open up a different GitHub repo so I can show you what that looks like specifically.  \
Them: And you can also tell me to ask Claude Code to tell me how to do it. If that's.  \
Me: Oh, no. Yeah, but this is, like, an easy one, and this is a visual thing. So right here is our internal developer version of this repository that we use to both build out a lot of this stuff, basically.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: So if I click on this, it has my full chat history right here. So I can go back and see.  \
Them: Fantastic.  \
Me: Forever and can get back into it because.  \
Them: Oh, fantastic.  \
Me: And, like, I'll even show you. Like, this morning I ran into an issue I was trying to. Fix a bug. Was it this one? No, I think it was it. Was. Yes, it was. This one. Okay, so I was in a pre. Let me pull it up over here. In a previous conversation. I think it was this one right here. Yes. And I kept getting this error. I kept getting API error. Like, some. Sometimes Claude will just, like, glitch out and freeze on you. Like, it's just tech, right? Like, you're gonna run into these things. And I was like, oh, no, this conversation is huge. Like, it's a long thread. I've been working on stuff. And I'm like, crap, how am I gonna pick back up? And I tried sending messages again to hit if you hit Escape or hit the stop button down here and then prompt it again sometimes. That that's all you need to do. And it was like, pick right back up and, like, keep going. Other times like this, I kept hitting this API error and it just like would not work. So what I did was I came up here before I started getting this error, and I literally, like, copy and pasted. Not the whole thing, but, like, I went upstream enough. And just went into a fresh thread. Which I think was. Yeah, here. Was it this one? Or no, this one right here and I just told it. Hey, below is a part of a conversation from a different thread that ended up glitching out and corrupting. I can't get it to work anymore. I need you to review this so you're up to speed and then help me pick up where we left off, basically. And so that's a little meta tip here on how you can, like, you're gonna run into issues like this every now and then. And this is a good way to, like, get through that process.  \
Them: Tyler, there's a whole bunch of things in the chat about how did you. Where did you go to access the chat history? And also everybody wants the sound.  \
Me: Okay? Cool. Well, I'll do that. The easiest way for me to do that is probably going to be. To take the. What The. How I do that is. It's called a hook. So Claude code has what are called hooks, and you can basically go in and. When certain events happen within Claude code, you can have it do different things automatically. And so I have mind set up that anytime that it finishes a task, It sends what it did to a. A voice agent or like a. Not a voice agent, but like a voice. I think I'm using OpenAI's real time voice. To send it the prompt, create a message, and then send it back to me audibly and just, like, play it out loud. Because it's very common. You can ask Sara that. I have, like, multiple threads going, and they don't necessarily, like, pop up and say, ding, hey, like, the Easy Bake Oven is ready. Like, you can come back and read this. I had to create some sort of a notification for myself, and audio was the easiest way, so I will. Have Claude help me create the hook and the easy install thing that I'll send through in an email. That will. You guys can just, like, basically copy that and, like, install it or have Clog install it on your behalf. It'll be pretty easy. There will be. I'll try and do it in a way, too, because it costs just a hair, like, a tiny bit of money to do that. Because it is like generating that. That voice. Because it says something different every time. It's like it's talking to me, right? So it does incur, like, a very small amount of money. I'll see if there's an open source project that we could use as well, so if people want to do it. For free. We can do it that way also. So we'll give them. Give you all options. Cool.  \
Them: Feels like a letter on the cake. So thank you for that, and thank you for your patience and time with me today. Much appreciated.  \
Me: Thank you. Thank you for being our guinea pig up here. I appreciate.  \
Them: Anytime.  \
Me: And then. Like just against the how to access past chat history up here in the upper left hand corner. If you click on this. You'll have a drop down menu that shows up and you can access past chats. Or if you're clicking on this orange icon up here in the upper right hand corner, this is the Claude emblem. That opens a brand new chat. And again in the upper left hand corner, you can see past conversations. So you can get to one this way as well. Cool. All right. Y'all.  \
Them: All right. There. I have been answering a whole bunch of questions in the Q and A, but I've kind of left the troubleshooting ones for us to kind of, like, work with. But I know Alberto has his hand up. I'm guessing, to join us on. On the panel.  \
Me: Cool. Let's go. With me. Sorry. We know your digital hand's got to be getting tired there, Alberto. Sorry about that.  \
Them: Would you like me to bring him up? Oh, I think he's saying he didn't mean it.  \
Me: Oh, we didn't mean to. Okay. All right, no worries.  \
Them: Okay? All right, so should we work through any, like, just the Q and A? So Baxter's asking, which documents would we need to bring over from the Mind Valley AI mastery students folder we downloaded from GitHub? If we want to use this framework with another company we're working with. Does that make sense?  \
Me: How would we. How would they do that with a whole new company to basically, like, recreate what we're building here for someone new?  \
Them: That's what I'm understanding. Baxter, let us know in the chat. Or put your hand up if you want to ask that online.  \
Me: Cool. Yeah. And, like, part of this is going to be kind of skipping ahead a little bit. Okay, so that's exactly it. So I would say, Baxter, that's something that I would say for, like, next Friday's session maybe, because. You're going to need to know more than what you know today so far. Like, at this point, like, we're getting all of the workshop set up in. In. We got Claude code set up. We have GitHub pulled down. We're doing the brand voice analyses, and then we're doing the, like, personalization of our agent. Next week is when we're going to talk about taking that and putting it into all the production parts in the NAN workflow. For Hattie B's. So once we get done with that and, and y'all understand that process, I think that it would be a better place to be able to then say, okay, if you want to replicate this exact thing and do it for a completely new company, how would you do it? I think that that's. Probably the best way to do it, because I have a feeling if I try to show you all now, it's gonna. It could. It could. We could lose a lot of people. It would be my concern.  \
Them: Yeah. And like what? We're the infrastructure of what we've built. Is based on a lot of teachings that we actually like, our approach and stuff like that that we actually take. So you guys are getting the outcome essentially, like, you're jumping right through to the, like, the next step. Because we can't teach, you know, four weeks worth of material in two sessions. But we wanted you to give you something, like, tangible. I hope I'm saying your name. Do you? Tr I got stuck with installing GitHub and VS code it doesn't accept except my computer access password.  \
Me: Okay? So. When it would be helpful to like. So here's another thing, too, just to clarify. Anyone who has been submitting questions into the the form. I think there's like a Google form that, that we've been using in here. We have been answering those and sending back a response to it, or will rather and a a prompt if, if it's applicable for you to give back to Claude to help get you unblocked. Basically, that was a common thing, like Windows machines, specifically, if you're on PC. I made the joke in the video the other day, like, the easiest way to fix this is going to go to www.apple.com and go purchase a brand new MacBook. I'm joking, y'all. For real, though, like, PC folks, just like each platform, you're going to run into, like, issues, right? For whatever reason, PCs have an issue getting some of the GitHub CLI installed. That might be what you're running into. Was it Dtric? Is that what you said their name was? I missed it. I'm sorry. Sorry.  \
Them: I. I kind of pronounce your name properly, so I hope you're that.  \
Me: Yes, Sorry about that. Yeah. If you can do us a favor and use that form and even send us some screenshots of what you're seeing. We will. We see those. Ileana's been, like, sending those to us, and we can see them in the responses section. We will literally, like, look at it, generate. A response and send that back to you. And that. That goes for anyone else in here. If y'all hit a blocker that you. You try working with Claude and you can't get around it. Like we're answering those and, like, trying to get the responses back to folks to help. I'm imagining that it's probably what I'm describing. You're going to need to go to. Let me pull it up here. It's not going to replicate it exactly because I'm on a. I'm on a Mac, right? So let's see here. So it's like. I think. It's like cli. Yeah, cli.GitHub.com so you would want to come to cli.GitHub.com. And download this. And work through the installation. If you're on a Mac in the loom video that we did, or it's actually on Descript, but that's a moot point. Like the video that I shot that shows how to do this on a Mac. You can just, like, go do it directly. We give you the commands, and it walks. You through it completely. For PCs, though, you need to come here and download this first to help circumnavigate this. Like this is also, I'm thinking what you're hitting is a very similar issue to what. I think it was Panda was the name on. On Wednesday's session that they were trying to install it, and they were hitting a blocker and, like, Claude code even helped them, like, navigate through getting that fixed. So I'm. I'm guessing that this is the same sort of thing you're hitting.  \
Them: Yeah. And like we said at the beginning, we're going to send through a like, how to prompt your way out of problems. Because, like, it's just a different way of working. I know that this is like. Like, you hit a wall and you panic, and our instinct is like, we're the humans, but sometimes the bots are even better than the humans.  \
Me: On. Yeah. And we're. We're happy to help, like, as much as we can, but also teaching y'all how to fish, like, a part of that. A big a tip that we could give you is that. If you can explain what you're running into, like, as best as you can, and also take screenshots. Like, you can give screenshots to Claude. So let me show you how to do that as well, even if you don't have Claude code. Set up and you're hitting a blocker further upstream than that even. You could go into just like, regular Claude or chat GPT and have it, like, walk it help walk you through the thing. But, like, right here, if we hit forward slash in Claude code, That brings up all the different commands or some of the different commands you can run. Attach file. Is how you would do that. Or if right here you can click on the forward slash and it also brings up this menu to attach a file. So that's a way to be able to go. Give it a screenshot. Let Claude see what you're seeing. And that's like giving it much better information to help you diagnose, and it give you the steps on how to, like, get out of the situation that you're in. I can't tell you how many times I've done this for just all sorts of things in life. I literally last year. This is completely like unrelated example, but last year. I h. Vac unit went out, like, right in the middle of a huge snowstorm. I'm like, what the heck? So I went out there and was chatting with the bot on my phone. And taking pictures of the model number and, like, what I was seeing and everything, and having it help me diagnose the whole thing, and it freaking did it. That's what was amazing. So that's where I'm saying, like, when we're saying, teach it to fish. The more that you can verbally explain to it or type out and explain what you're running into. Give it pictures as well. Like the intelligence of these things is. Is wild.  \
Them: Okay? I think there was someone who wanted to join us on stage. Sandra. Before we go to Sandra, while you're coming on stage, I will ask one question from Lisa. When executing the form, I was getting an error in the phase one plus two node. Because it needed an API key from Claude, not open router. Worked with Claude coat fix, but it ended up just getting an API key from Claude. I did not have the open router API key already available, so I'm not sure what went wrong there.  \
Me: Gotcha. Okay. So that's just, like, a little point of confusion that Claude might have had right there. Because what's happening is we're having you use a clawed model on that step in the workflow. And so it might have gotten confused, and it was trying to get you to go get an anthropic API key. So the people that make Claude, like, get the API key directly from them, which you could totally do. Which it sounds like that's what you did, too. You didn't do anything wrong by doing that. But you can also use the Open Router API key, and that allows you to access a whole plethora of different models. And you won't run into rate limits if that's like a brand new account that you have on Anthropic. So, like, you didn't do it wrong. There's, like, more than one way to solve that, and you did it perfectly there.  \
Them: Maybe we should explain what rate limit is as well.  \
Me: Yes. Thank you. So, rate limit.  \
Them: For sure.  \
Me: Yeah, like when, when you're using an API key that's like, imagine this is like you now have like a developer account set up with OpenAI or Google or, or Anthropic for Claude. They have different tiers of that, as you might imagine, and the more money that you spend with them over time. The more access that they give you to their models. And when they. When we say rate limit, that means that sometimes they'll only let you send X number of information. At at a time, or they'll only let you send X number of messages. Over a certain period of time before they just block it and are like, nope, you hit your ceiling. As you spend more money with them. It's like a pay to play thing. They're like, you're a great customer, we're bumping you up to tier two, tier three, whatever, and your rate limits increase.  \
Them: It's kind of like a credit score, right? Like, it's kind of like that. You build up, like a credit.  \
Me: That's a good way of putting it. Yeah. And so, like, it's the way that you can circumnavigate that. Because this is something we run into a lot in our. In our regular class is that when people start up fresh API keys and they don't want to go spend a bunch of money on the account, like, loaded in there. Right. You could hit limits, and it's really frustrating to do that. So we say it's good to go ahead and set up those accounts directly with the providers that you want to be using. And start using those keys. But also have open router API keys as well. Because that's like. Imagine that as, like the Airbnb for API keys. Like, they have them for all these different models. They don't have rate limits on them, so you can use them as much as you want. They cost the same amount of money. So it's. But. But the downside of using it is that you're not able to build up your. Your credit score or street cred directly with anthropic. Like, you're not climbing tiers on them. By using open router.  \
Them: Yeah. So, like, think about open router as the aggregator. Like, they've built up a really great credit score and they have access to all of the, like, rate limited. Like, they have no limits. And you're essentially buying or, like, using or leveraging their, like, what they've built up to be able to access as much as you need. It's a pay to play. It's kind of like using Daddy's credit score. Or something. It's kind of like you're going. You go shopping for a mortgage or something like that, and that's how you. Yeah, that's how you get your first property or something. I don't know.  \
Me: Nice.  \
Them: That analogy is, like, helpful.  \
Me: Love it.  \
Them: Okay, sandra, thank you.  \
Me: Thank you. So much. Good morning, good evening, wherever you're calling in from.  \
Them: Hello. Thank you for letting me ask a couple of questions. So I have two questions and a request. The first question is that I did the entire thing with the document, kind of like a software developer. Trying to figure things out, but I was also allowing Claude to do the heavy lifting because I was like, I don't understand code. You get it done. So that was good. But then when I went to watch the video, there were a couple of steps that you have in the video that weren't reflected in the document. And I. I wanted to have, like, clarification. Because we got a paid subscription for Claude Desktop. But we're communicating with Claude. Code is code. Like a child of clout, Desktop. And then in the video, you talk about giving Claude the stop access to the documents so he knows what code is having access to. And that confused me because I thought they were both connected. So can you clarify what is the relationship here between both?  \
Me: Yeah, for sure. Okay, so Claude Desktop and Claude AI are. It's a separate product from Anthropic. And clog code is like. So that's like, product one, cloud code is product two. They don't natively yet talk back and forth to each other. So you can't necessarily like have that project set up in Claude desktop and it just automatically know what you're doing in cloud code. Like, there's no like crossover memory or things like that. You will set that up as a part of the onboarding. When you set up the bridge and you get that going back and forth, that's like something that we've built custom to help with that. And then when you do that, let me even, like, show this, too, because, again, like, it makes it easier for me to, like, talk and. Kind of demonstrate this at the same time. So this is a clog project. Let me come back over here to this one. So here's one that we set up. I think on Wednesday's session. To verify that the the bridge between two of the different repositories. So this is the Claude desktop app. So to be very clear, And then once I had this set up, when I look at the files right here, if I click plus, You can click on GitHub. And if you have committed your GitHub repo back up to. Up to GitHub, then you can come in here and select it. And I have a bunch of them, so let me just grab this one as an example. So this is the students repo. We would select this. And so basically, this is what this is saying is that we are connecting and syncing our private version of our GitHub repo that we just kind of showed when we did that V thing a minute ago. So that private version is what we want to sink in here and hit add files. And this will sync it into the. The knowledge base within the projects. And it will also keep it up to date. Like, you have to maybe sometimes come in here and click resync from time to time, but it should keep it up to date. And now when? You are after. You have like the GitHub, CLI and all that stuff set up as well when you type in here. And you have the instructions in here. It should know how to use the bridge, so it should know how to write information. And update it into the repo from Claude Desktop. And then when we go into Claude code over here. It's actually updating it into this bridge section. And so if you have Claud. E Desktop, if you give it the prompt, I mean, CLAUDE code, if you give it the prompt that Claude Desktop gives you to give to it, it will then go and pull down that note that CLAUDE Desktop just wrote for it and pull that down so it can go read. And they're talking back and forth that's how they're kind of staying in sync with each other. Does that make sense? I know this is like a complicated kind of like how we.  \
Them: But then. But then, are we going to be having these conversations with Claude desktop, or we're just having the conversation with Claude code? Like, what is the interaction here?  \
Me: Yeah. So you can do both, right? And there's benefits to doing both. I think of it as that Claude code. Can do a lot. You can come in here and have brainstorming sessions with it. You can have it go and take action, and it has many more tools to go and do things on your behalf. Like move files around, go do things on the Internet, pull them down and then add them into your repository and then commit that for you, stuff like that. What it does not have. Is, by default, is a vector database, so a knowledge base. That it searches against semantically. I know. I'm, like, saying some tech pro words. I'll come back and explain that in a minute. But instead it goes and, like, looks for the actual file and reads the whole file, like the whole thing, end to end, and keeps that in its context. And then it does the job. If we're in, Claude. Desktop over here. And we have this in or any other files added into this file store right here. This is what's called a vector store. And the way that that works is very different. This can also go and, like, pull down information straight from GitHub and read it end to end. But it can also do the semantic search. And the way that that works is it writes a message. It's like Tyler asked me to go figure out. Where am I at in this process of, like, doing my brand voice analysis? And I asked that over here in Claude Desktop. What that agent does is it will write internally. It writes questions and ask questions against this file store and it retrieves what are called chunks. This is rag database, is what this is. It's retrieval augmented generation. It goes and grabs little chunks of the information, not the whole page. Only the ones that are most relevant. And brings it back into its context window. So that's very different in how they work. And there's, like, pluses and minuses to that. It's good when you need to do semantic retrieval like that, because it can bring a lot of different information from different areas of documents or files that you have in here and pull them from all of those like little bite sized pieces back to the agent. Whereas if you're doing it like it's doing it over in Claude code, It couldn't do that. It couldn't go pull. It depends on the context, window size, right? But it couldn't go and pull, like 100 different documents, read all of them end to end. It would, like, blow out its memory. It wouldn't be able to hold it all in its brain, so that's. Where the vector store helps with that process. I know that's a really big concept we're talking about right here, so hopefully that's clear on how I'm explaining.  \
Them: And. Like. One way, one way that I like to think about it is that, like, you know, because we're all used to Google search or whatever, right? That's like a keyword search. So if you do a keyword search, The AI could miss what you actually mean. With context search. It's not looking necessarily for just the keyword, it's looking for meaning. So it's looking for like what? Like it's not necessarily just the word that is looking for. It's looking for the concept or the meaning. And that's why you can bring in more of that information, because the AI is able to, like, figure out what's the meaning is that you're trying to pull from and bring in more of that context over.  \
Me: Yeah. People were asking, is that Claude AI or the web version? The Claude project. And which is the desktop and the Claw AI. And the reason it's doing that is because what's called the vector store, and the vector store is retrieval augmented generation, which is rag. And if you all want to sound super nerdy to your friends at the holidays, it's good to know how this works, right? When it's doing semantic search, like what Sara is describing. It's not going. And looking through the words like what we do. There's a process called embeddings. Where when we upload information into the project folder in there, it converts that into a mathematical node that goes and lives in latent space, which is like the way that I try and visualize this is imagine actual outer space. And if the moon is cat, and let's say Mars is dog, they are close to each other and they're mathematical representations of how they're stored in this database. And if I have, like, Hattie B's hot chicken. That's like, not even in the Milky Way, in the database. Like, it's completely in a different space. So when it goes and does this retrieval and it does semantic search, it's not looking for words, it's literally looking for the vectors. It's a math, like a math, like a numerical representation. Of it and looking for the numbers that are closest related to that. So. It's really difficult to kind of visualize and conceptualize that, but that's what's happening. And it's hard to think that, how the heck is a computer, like, at the speed of light, going and pulling this information? That is a number. Converting it back into something that is coherent and makes sense. Thinks about it and then responds back to us, and in some instances, even audibly talks out loud, like my claw does to me. Whenever you break it down like that, it's like, good God. We are cave people that don't even understand how this stuff works, honestly.  \
Them: Yeah. So I based on all you guys have been explaining these again and again, but it still is kind of abstract, at least for me. I was wondering if it is possible to have like an interactive mind map. Where I can separate the theoretical, the concept, the philosophy of what we're building, and then the tools and why we are using these tools. Because right now, for me, there's the confusion between the tool and the mindset behind what I'm trying to build, because it's two new concepts, right? So if you can put together, like an infographic or a mind map that we can see. Oh, we're using open router API because this. Or we're using this API because of that, or kind of to put everything together so I know what I'm building, and then I can extrapolate it to what I want to do for my business.  \
Me: Perfect. Yes, we could totally do that. We'll put some graphs together. In fact, I'll just take the transcript from this.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Sandra, and we'll use that to create a couple of different assets and send them back out. And we'll either do that via email or we'll figure out the easiest way to reshare it, too. And then if you have questions, definitely ask us. We're happy to help on that.  \
Them: And I want. I want to also acknowledge what you're saying because, like, you guys are trusting us with. With the process. And Maria knows this. Like, this is an actual, like. Like literal, step by step, like, intensive. And you guys are, like, jumping right down the. The middle, like, in the deep end, in the. In the pool with us. And you're like, yeah, we'll do it. And. And so, like, I just wanted to recognize that also, like, if you're feeling like, whoa, this is intense. It is. It is totally intense. But, I mean, you guys can do it. You're just proving it. So we're just here to, like. Yeah. Scaffold it as well.  \
Me: Exactly. And the whole reason that we're teaching you all in this fashion as well. This is even what we're upgrading a lot of our own ways that we're teaching an AI build lab is this whole mentality around becoming an orchestrator. You need to understand things and. Your knowledge is only going to increase the more you use this stuff. But to collapse down the time that it takes you to get up to speed, you just need to know how to follow a few different things, and the systems can help you move along at a much faster pace. And that's our goal of what we're trying to do, not only in this class and in our other classes that we're teaching. Too.  \
Them: And Ayleen's asked a really good question. I think this is a great question, Daley. Thank you for asking it, because we went way down the rabbit hole. We went way past the Eighth Dimension, we stars and beyond. We were in the Milky Way galaxy, guys. So, okay, let's bring it right down to the third dimension. This is what's happening. Where you need to do is you need to be go through the homework for part one. Right. What you're doing in part one is you're getting the setup, right? You're getting everything set up so that you can go and, like, essentially start the building process or building it all together. Part two of the homework. Is where you will be setting the foundations for the agentic workflow for the agentic department that we're going to bring all together next week. So there are some like, you're going to be building an agent and customizing it and all of that. And we'll have a step by step process. But essentially where we need everybody by Wednesday. Is that you have done part one and part two. And don't forget, you do have a bonus Monday session with us in case you get stuck in any of those things for us to, like, you know, help you get there before Wednesday. So yeah.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Thank you.  \
Me: Someone's asking are pandas. Asked about the echo workflows. So we'll go back and show that again here in just a minute because we did make an update to that. So I want to show how we did that, because someone asked that question earlier, too, about how do I take the work I already did and convert it to the new one. So before we do that, though, I want to make sure. Sandra, did we answer your questions? Do you have any other ones?  \
Them: No, no, I'm good. I'm good. You guys are amazing. Thank you.  \
Me: Yeah. Sweet. You're very welcome. Thank you again for coming up in front of class for everybody. Appreciate you. Let's see here. Okay. Let's do this, then go ahead.  \
Them: Just so you know, like, we also still have 13 questions in the Q and A, just like, contextualizing the time and everything like that as well.  \
Me: Oh, wow. Okay, cool. All right. I'll try and be quick here on this, then. Sorry, it's a lot to cover, and we want to make sure. We're trying to get to everybody's questions and getting the download to your out of our heads and into yours as quickly as we can. Okay? All right, so what this is going to look like when you get this set up and you get done with project one or homework one and homework two? Is, you're going to have the echo workflow in here. And you're going to have the knowledge management webhooks in here. This is what's causing us personally issues on our end that it's not letting us use these because of our Nadin account. And so what I've been doing is going back and rebuilding this in a different native account that we have to try and get while the NADN team is fixing this for us so that we can show you all exactly in the video how this works. The Echo Brand voice, though we have changed the workflow slightly because we have two different triggers in here. So the TLDR on this now is there are two echo workflows that are in the current updated student repo. So if you have pulled down the latest version, like what we showed a little while ago, you should have two echo workflows in there. If you're not seeing that, then either have it check again or ping us and we'll help you walk through it. The first one is a form. So we took the form off of the original workflow because it was taking a long time to run and would sometimes time out. And so to make this process easier, it's the same thing. Like, you're going to go into the form, you're going to get this once. It's all set up. You get this URL in here. You're going to come and paste that into a new window, like what we showed on Wednesday, and you're going to fill out your information in here. So this is where you're going to put your email. Your personal brand voice is what we're doing. You're going to put your name in. You don't have to put the company name in. That's just for next Friday when we're trying to show you all how could you do brand voice analysis for a new company, all these sorts of things. You're going to put in your examples of your mega doc right here. And then you're going to hit submit. And then what happens? It'll pop up and show you. Like, hey, thank you for submitting this. Give it about, like, 10 to 15 minutes and we'll send you an email. And then to make this easier on everyone, like, what we've done is let me switch back over to the tab. We now have the original echo flow that we had in here. Now. Catches all that information, and so this is what it looks like. And so when you fill out that form, that form then passes all that information into this node. This node is then coming through. It's parsing out the information, it's doing the setup to validate, make sure everything's correct, that there's enough detail there, and then it splits it out on if it was personal or company or combined, and it routes it through all this. To ultimately get it to these nodes right here. And again, all of this is like 90% of the way set up, and Claude code is going to help you set it up the rest of the way. This is where you're going to need to put in your different API keys, and you might have to do some other parts that I'm going to not be able to recall because of, like, dad brain in real time. But Claude knows what you should be doing, and it'll help you walk through and help, even on your behalf, come in and get all this set up for you. And here all the steps that it's doing your brand voice analysis. And then after that. It takes that and merges them together, and then it does the XML generation of the little snippet that you're going to go put into your agent so that it sounds more like you. And then in the past, it was just going to spit this back out to you in a file. And I didn't think that was, like, the easiest or best way to do it. So instead, it's now going to be, it should be emailing you all. So if you have Gmail, which we have as part of the onboarding thing, it's going to just email you the reports when it's all done. And mine even did this earlier. So this is what it looks like. It sent me an email once that second workflow now finishes, and it's just like, hey, here's your brand voices, and it gives you two files to download. So here's what it looks ugly when I'm opening it up in here, but it gives you the snippet that you're going to go give to Claude to have you update and personalize your sugar agent. So that email copywriting agent, this is what we need for that. And then it gives you your brand. Voice analyses in here. And this isn't like all of them. Right. But it's like, you would pull down this file, and this is what we're going to take and upload into our Librarian into the stacks. So that's what we would do. And literally, once it's all set up, here's my version of the stacks. Claude again will walk you through getting all this up to speed. It's mainly going to be you coming in here and getting your Gemini API key and putting it in, getting your webhook address and putting that in, choosing the Knowledge Store or creating your first section of the library, if you want to think of it like that. That you're going to be adding books to, which is like your brand voice. So you can come in and call it something like Tyler's brand voice. And then literally all you're going to be doing is going and grabbing that brand voice file that got emailed to you and adding it into that, like, uploading it. I'm just going to grab something and upload it, just as an example. So I'm going to click open, upload it. And then this one's timed out because I've had this open for a minute. But it would come down here and tell you a success if it uploaded correctly and it pops up down here in the upper right or the lower right hand corner. And if it fails too, try it again and grab that error message. Because maybe you didn't have something set up all the way and you can go back and share that with Claude and it can help you debug it, like right here too. It'll even tell you in this activity log. You could even come in and highlight this and give it to Claude so it sees what you've been doing and where it's erroring out to help you get this initially, like all this front end connected and working, so it becomes as easy as, like dragging and dropping it in here. And now it's available in your. Library. Hopefully that's clear. So that's kind of the main difference, though, was just like the experience that you all will have when you're doing the Echo brand voice workflow. It's now two workflows. There's one that has the form and sends you the message so you don't. Have to sit there and wait on it, and then it just now will email you the results of that workflow when it's done. Again. It was just like, so you all don't have to go fumbling through NADM to try and find everything in there.  \
Them: I've already answered Jeff's question about stacks, but people are, like, kind of asking, like, what is it there for? Like, how does it fit in, essentially?  \
Me: Okay, cool. So. Let me.  \
Them: And Jof is also asking how do you interact? Like what is a process of interacting with it since you've got your screen share up.  \
Me: Cool. Yeah. So let me move this up here. Sorry. I'm trying to move Zoom stuff so I can see you all. Okay? So let's just come. Is this the right one? No, this is my other one. Let's come over here. I have too many. Find an N8 in account I can or one I can get in and not break something here. All right, so in the way that this stacks works. Is because I think it'll help if we start here. So if we come over here to the actual email workflow. Where a new email comes in from for Hattie B's. And then it gets handed off to all the different agents, right? And the agents are doing their job on the AI team. And when you get to ones like Hatch, which is the expert agent, it has this tool right here called the Librarian tool. And this librarian tool is a Google Gemini agent that is connected to the information, that vector store that is in Google. And we're getting that information into the librarian's library. Via the stacks. And that's mainly because when Google released that product, they were trying to make it easier and more accessible for people, but they did not build their own front end. So you have to kind of know how to do some light coding to be able to do that programmatically, and it's kind of a pain. In the butt. But it's a really good product, though, right? And it's affordable. So because we knew we wanted to use that Google Gemini vector store. We needed to build out a front end for that, to make it easy and accessible for everyone to add books into their libraries. And that's what the Stacks is. We built that custom for this class to be able to use that front end. And it's also something you could use like moving forward, because again, Google did not come up with, like, an easy, no code way to just drag and drop stuff in there. I think that that's a real miss on their part. Honestly, when they first came out. I was really surprised to see that they didn't even just make it easy. To select files from your Google Drive and say hey, I want to send them to my Gemini file store or something. Like there's not even a way it's natively integrate that. I suspect that they'll eventually do that, but for now we had to build our own custom thing, which is what we've given to you all. So the stacks, though. The librarian looks at the files that are in the stacks. Semantically, like what we talked about a minute ago, it is also an agent. And instead of just returning the chunks, it knows that it's a part of this AI team, and it knows that Hatch asks it a question. And so if Hatch is like, we'll get an email that's like, hey, do we have any gluten free options on the menu or something? Hatch might say, hey, I need to go and check our library to find out the knowledge base. It asks the librarian about that. The librarian goes and pulls those chunks. From the knowledge the books that we have in the library, thinks on it, generates a response, also cites its sources of like, where did it pull that from? Confidence score in it, all that kind of stuff, and sends it back to the Hatch agent. So the librarian is like a sub agent is the way you would think of it. Hatch, then thinks of it through its area of expertise. Does its work and passes it to on down the line. When it gets to sugar. Sugar is trying to write that email, right? And so Sugar is also connected to the library and tool, but it uses it differently. When it asks a question, it's drafting an email, and it's like, hey, I wrote this email. Is it correct? Does it sound on brand? Does it sound like Tyler? It's going to send those sort of messages internally to the librarian. The librarian is going to go look at the brand voice analyses that we have in there and compare that to what Sugar has sent it over, and it will send the message back to. Sugar and say, hey, yeah, this looks good. You sound authentically like, Tyler, good to go. Go ahead and send that email on. Or maybe like, no, Tyler would have phrased it differently based off of his brand analysis. So that's how it's using the information. It's kind of the easiest way I can think of to explain it. Now how we get the information in there. Again because it's a great system, but Google doesn't make an easy way to do it. That is why we have this knowledge management system right here with all these different hooks. So when we are using that front end of the stacks, like that website that we're going to go look at here in a minute, it can create a store. A store is like a section in the library section in the knowledge base. If we need to delete a file, like we need a webhook that goes in and actually takes the steps to do that for us. If we want to connect in a Google Drive folder that we could dump stuff into and it gets added into the library, we needed to set that up. If we want to be able to list out what are all the even all the books in this section of the library. That's a different function. If we need to list out what are all the sections in the library, that's again, that's a different function. If we need to upload something into the library. That's yet another one. So, look, these are all these different actions that we need to be able to take to get information into the Gemini file, search to keep it updated, to delete it, like, whatever it might be. And as you all can see, this is complicated, right? If you all didn't have. Or even me. Like, if I didn't have Claude code or an ability to be able to understand and build out a front end. That looks like the stacks over here. That would be a really kind of a pain in the butt to use that product from Google. But now, since we've made this, whenever we take an action over here, like, if I come in here and delete this file, Just clicking this button. I need to refresh this page for it to work. But if I did that, this is just the front end interface. And what this does is that sends a message back over here to the N8N workflow that we had. That is the delete document. Folder. So, like, we click a button, but on the back end, this executes the code that actually goes and deletes the thing. So it's like the stacks is the front end of the library. The N8N workflows right here is like the pipeline in between. And then the Gemini file search is the actual vector database or RAG database. That where it's like keeping the library books in and that's like how all this plays together.  \
Them: Okay? So think of the stacks as, like, the door to the library. It's like passageway, or the way that you get into the library. It's like the way that you pass your books into the library and then. Yeah. And that kind of thing. And also, you guys. In the information that we're going to send. We've got, like, glossary, like a glossary thing coming. I think there's FAQs already. But we there will have definitions of like Stack and who the different agents are and why why they're there and all of the different definitions as well. So we wanted to consolidate that all into one place. So you can just refer to it during the course. Because this is a lot like you're learning. And this is honestly, this is why we, like, give things funny names. Because are you going to remember what a vector database is, or are you going to remember, like, library books in a library? Right? Like, that's why. And the sugar agent. Like, if we just said agent 1, 2, 3, 4. Would you remember which agent does what? But if we give them personalities. They're like, oh, yeah, sugar is this, and the bishop is this and whatever, you know, so.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: I saw Joffrey asked about connecting them. So that is where, when Claude Code is helping you set up your Stacks page, like your little website page, which is run completely locally. It's not actually going out live on the Internet, it just runs in your own browser locally. And it has all the. And Claude helps you set up all of the NADN workflows for the knowledge base that we just showed. Claude will then connect the NAN workflows. To the stacks for you. So it should walk you through that process. And if it hasn't and you're trying to use it, That's when you take the error message. Do a screenshot, tell it to go and check, and it will literally go and troubleshoot it and fix it on your behalf and connect all the parts and pieces for you. And it also fixes all the code so that it sends the actual code snippets. And files to Google, so it goes and does that on your behalf as well. It's very meta, but.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: It's amazing how that works.  \
Them: I'm like, we love your teachings, like how we bounce off each other. And this is why, like, we're like, hey, we come as a team because we know that there's something about the way that both of us teach. Like, I can never teach as well as he does, and he can never, like, do what I do. And we just feed off each other, and it's like, it works. That's why we always, like, insist on coming as a team and doing things. Tyler, do you like? I'm just. I also want to be respectful of other people's time. We're cool to hang. And I know we're already way past time, but. But people are probably still waiting for their answers. So should we do, like, a quick, like, thing of the Q and A to make sure people who have been waiting can also get their questions answered?  \
Me: Yes, we can do that. Like one quick one. I saw I want to answer for I see it disappear. Someone asked about how did we get the stacks built. You don't have to build it. The front end is already built. You're just like having cloud. Have you set it up? But surprise, surprise, I had Claude Code and the new Gemini Pro 3 agent build out all of that front end for me. I just described what I wanted it to do. How I wanted it to work, what I wanted it to look like, and then built that whole freaking website out for me and the whole front end infrastructure. It's amazing. That's what I'm saying. Like building. Once you all learn this, Building at the front end experience that either you or a client or whoever might see it's a product, basically. And how do you connect the guts of it, of the back end of it, of what we're doing in Nav and what we're doing in Claude code? And all that sort of stuff. That's what we're saying. The possibilities of what you all can do once you learn this process is amazing.  \
Them: Yeah. You guys are the best, honestly. I feel. I feel like you're our crew. Honestly, I want to, like, adopt you guys. Okay, so should we do, like, a quick fire?  \
Me: Yeah, sure.  \
Them: Can you explain the bridge How Claude Desk Desktop is supposed to access the information in GitHub?  \
Me: Yes. And in fact, I'm going to be meta about this also, just because if I talk, if you all can't tell, I am not the most concise person. Claude co can do this. And this is also, like, shows you the differences on how you can have these agents talk to you. Hey, Claude, I need you to do me a favor. We're in the Friday live session right now. And some students are asking, how does the bridge system work between Claude code and Claude desktop? Can you give me the very tldr easy to understand practical explanation that is technically sound that I can share here in class, please? Thank you. So y'all could do this same sort of stuff when you're chatting against any of the information. That you're connected to. But again, this is going to explain it probably much more succinctly than I will. Okay, so the problem is, Claude Desktop is great at thinking strategy, memory, big picture. Claude Code is great at doing the research, building and file management. Neither is perfect at both, which is true. And we kind of touched on this a little. Bit earlier. The solution is the bridge.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: How it works is Claude Desktop writes a task spec. So it writes a file, it drops it into this folder system right here, which is using GitHub. Claude code can then pick up that because Claude Desktop can commit it to GitHub. Claude code can then go get that, pull it and read the note, and then go take action on it. So think of it as we can have Claude desktop if it wants to give Claude code a task to go do, or vice versa. The bridge basically gives them a way to talk back and forth. Using that GitHub commit structure. And the way that it's working beyond that is there are some skills and Claude MD file in here and some other things that are instructions basically that tell Claude code and Claude desktop, they're custom to this. How do they use this bridge system? So they know how to do this back and forth and communicate to each other? So that's like, hopefully this explains a little bit more. And just for the sake of time. Again. A lot of this stuff is in the repo. Like, learning how do you chat against the information is a really valuable meta skill to learn here.  \
Them: Yeah. Okay, so there's a couple of questions here about. I'm going to try to keep answer first the questions that are specifically to do with the course, and then we, if we have time, we can go over other stuff. Should we disregard our old bridge tests when we update the repo?  \
Me: You can go ask them to test it again if you want to. At any time. You can ask either of the Claudes to. Let's. Hey. I just want to double check to make sure the bridge is still working properly. Write a test and then give me the prompt to give to the other agent. So if you did it from the desktop and you need to go see if Claude code can read it and vice versa, just have it write a new test for you and go check it out real quick and it can walk you through that.  \
Them: And then another question related to the bridge. What does setup 5 bridge test, test. Could you please clarify? Thanks.  \
Me: Set up five test test. I'm trying to remember. I'm not sure what they're talking about. If they're talking about, like, the onboarding thing or something, maybe step five onboarding.  \
Them: I think. I think it's to do with that.  \
Me: I think that's what it is. It's trying to describe how what I'm saying.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Is in the repo. When you pull that down as part of the onboarding process, Claude code should help you set up the bridge system. And that's what it's having you test as well. So even when I just described. Again, let me kind of show you. Here, share. Let me do this. Let's just do. I'll just stick in the same one. Hey, can you do me a quick favor and just write a test example in the for the Bridge system and the message to give back to the CLAUDE desktop agent so we can ensure that it's working properly? I'm trying to demo to the students how they could go do this to ensure that CLAUDE code has properly set up their bridge system when they're doing their initial onboarding. Oh, no. Where did it paste that in? Dang it. I didn't have my cursor in the right spot. Sorry. Hey, can you go do? Write a test for the bridge? I'm trying to demo when students are onboarding and they first get their bridge set up. And you, Claude coder helping them set that up. You're going to write a test to go back and forth between the two. Can you write a test now that I can go make sure that my bridge is functioning with Claude. Desktop, please. Okay? So I just asked it to write, could you all still hear me when I'm hitting MacWhisper? Is it cutting out? All right, cool.  \
Them: Okay? Yeah, I could hear you still. Yeah.  \
Me: Awesome. Just wanted to make sure MacWhisper wasn't goofing for me again. Okay. So, like, right now, you can see it understands because if it's internal instructions that we have that are a part of the repo, it's going to go read to understand how the bridge works, it's going to go write a template, and then it's going to create a task. So it's doing ping pong. Verification is what it's calling it. Okay? So I did this, and then it's telling me, so go to Claude.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Claude desktop and paste this. And then. I would. Grab this. It's even giving me, like the step by step. It's saying, like, show them the file, Claude. Desktop will give you a response like, either it's working or not. So then if we go back over here to Claude Desktop, and I need to go over to this other project, because it's a different bridge, like, for a different project, so I need to make sure I have that fixed correctly. If I paste this in. And do this. It should be able to see it. And if not? Actually, I might have to sync it down. We'll see. Mine might actually goof up. But if you all do this, it should work properly. Because I've been going back and forth on my claude of having it right to a student repo in the dev repo that I'm in. So hopefully I didn't confuse my Claude's right now. Yeah, so see, it's checking the pending folder. So this is where it is going out and looking at the GitHub to go and find it. So it's a discrepancy there. So anyway, if yours isn't set up properly. Mine? It must have written it to one of the student repos instead. That I just set up. It's not finding it. Or is it. Let's see here. Likely created locally. Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay, so it didn't commit it to. So if we take this response back and we go back, like, let's say that you get something like this, and it's not set up all the way yet, you take the response here, go back to Claude code. And give it the response and say, hey, I just ran the test and here is the response I got back from Claude Desktop. And then if you just paste in that response below that and hit send. It will then help go check the setup, troubleshoot it, and then give you another test. Again, I'm not going to do that on mine because this is not something you all are going to run into. My clauds are getting confused because I've got multiple it's like writing to multiple different repositories right here. But that's the process you would go through, though, to get this set up and make sure that it's working in the testing section, is what it's referring to. Cool.  \
Them: Okay. Elaine was asking, can I use regular GitHub vs GitHub CLI since CLI will not install on my desktop.  \
Me: Oh, wow. Okay, so, click. Is it a PC issue, maybe? Or are you on a Mac?  \
Them: I think that that's Tyler's first. If there's a problem, it's probably it's because of PC.  \
Me: There's no beef there. It's just a joke. But for real, though, if it's CLI is not installing, that could be the PC specific issue. Yes. Okay, so there's a long and a short answer to this. Yes, it is possible. To still use GitHub and use these have cloud code and desktop take actions on your behalf. It will try and go get the git. It might try and install the GitHub official MCP so that a GitHub tool that you can give to your agent Claude Code can go and install that for you. That works well. I have that installed also. For a whole plethora of reasons that to keep myself from going down a rabbit hole. If you can get the GitHub CLI tool installed, it's better. Basically, it allows you to do more stuff. And it does not. Take up as much room in the memory. Basically like when you have an MCP stool tool installed. It has to like whether you've used it yet or not. As soon as you launch a session, it has the MCP in there. It will send documentation to the agent that it's connected to to tell it how to use the tool, so it burns up the amount of space in the memory in that conversation. So that's why, if you can use the CLI tool, I would do it as your first path. Because mcp tools also work, but. With caveats. So I'll try and keep from, like, yeah, I could really go on that for a minute, but I'm not going to.  \
Them: Okay? Can I add an API credential for cloud code in Aten to facilitate any other needed feedback and forth.  \
Me: So are you saying. Can you have read that one more time?  \
Them: I'm also confused, Leah, if you want to clarify, but can I add an API credential for cloud code in innate N to facilitate any other needed back and forth.  \
Me: So you can't put Claude code into nad, but you can allow Claude code to run your nan or. Here we go. Here's Leo right here. If you're able to see if we're understanding your question right. Howdy.  \
Them: Yeah. Hi. I asked that question earlier when. We were doing some other. I forget what we were doing, but I was thinking about the credentials and. And what needed to be in. But then I also. Later you were going through some steps. I could see that the process would ask. For the APIs, or the APIs would be loaded in the form or something like that, so that they would be given to where they need to go. So I wasn't. I think I was getting ahead of myself.  \
Me: Correct. No. Yeah, you're good. So, yeah, if you want to have Claude be able to go and manage your Nadin account for you, like what we showed, that's when you're going to do that API setup where you generate the NAN API key, the test one, have it do the initial setup. And then once it's done, tell it you're going to replace that API key and tell you how to do that. Go delete the test one, generate the new one, and then that's when you manually have to enter it in there so that it's secure. I think that's. Maybe. Is that maybe, like, what you were trying to figure out, or was it something different?  \
Them: Yeah, I did that. I think I was just getting ahead because I ended up adding some credential.  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: Into N8N and I'm not sure what I was. Open router. I gave it open router.  \
Me: O. H. Okay. Yes. Okay, so even that. Let me show you here.  \
Them: Sorry. I'm moving you on screens, which is why I keep looking all over the place here.  \
Me: I completely understand. Y'all are just lucky I'm not wearing my VR goggles. Sorry. Makes fun of me when I wear those into meetings. So that allows me to, like, see all these screens all over the place. Okay, so. Let's just, like, even this one right here. So, like, this is an example. I just set up one of the agents right here. As a standalone little agent, so I could come in here and chat with it and just test it. But this will work. Just for this quick demo. If. If we were having Claude Code come and set all this up for us, it could totally do that. But to make this work fully, you're going to need a credential in here. So that this agent can have its own access to an LLM of some kind. So, like, that's where it can go ahead and get all that connected, or it's going to tell you, hey, you need to come in here and make an open router key or whatever it might be, and it might get it all the way, like, all, like, 95% of the way to the finish. Line and then tell you, hey, you need to come into NAD and do this next step to to connect open router the rest of the way. So that might have been what you were doing. I'm. I'm not certain.  \
Them: Okay, well, let me just ask you. You were in a N when you were just showing us all of that? You're in an yeah, okay.  \
Me: Yeah. So this. This is. This is Nan's interface right here.  \
Them: Okay? Yeah. Yep, yep.  \
Me: And.  \
Them: When you opened up the window, I couldn't tell that it was still an N8 end.  \
Me: This.  \
Them: And sometimes that gets a little confusing to know. Wait, which app? Which.  \
Me: Y. Eah.  \
Them: Tool. Are we in? Okay.  \
Me: So. Yeah. Sorry. No, thank you for asking. Just so that we. I'm sure I forget to, like, narrate some of this stuff, too. So, yeah, this. This is in an end right here. And, like this little node right here. Is the chat model that powers this agent right here is, like, what's actually visually happening. And so if I wanted to, like, temporarily disconnect anthropic, let's say, and I wanted to click on this and then let me move my zoom so I can see. I want it to connect it to open router instead. So I. I grab open router then I already have my open router connection set up. If I had not done that yet, it would tell me, hey, I need to go make a new credential.  \
Them: Yep.  \
Me: And so you could come in here and name this, like, open router, whatever. You go to get an API key, it's going to tell you to go to open router AI and like, walk you through how to go do that. You go get the API key from there and come back in here and paste it and then it works. So, like, I. I've already done that. And then it shows up in this list like this. You can come select it. And then down here. Now. Like, look at this, y'all. Like, this is what Open router is cool. Look at all these models that we have to choose from. Like, there. If you ever wanted to try any kind of model, let's even go and look at, like, Deep seq.3.2 just came out. Let's see if it's showing up in here. 3.3.2. Find. Ing. It might be a pain. There it is. 3.2. Right here. Boom. So now if. If I wanted to run this instead of anthropic on a deep seat model, I could do that now. I would need to save this. And I've, like, reconnected this little line right here so it's connected. And we're. We're off to the races. So then if I wanted to come and. Let me save it really quickly. And just so I don't break this thing, let me disconnect this tool for just a second. And. Refresh this chat log. Hey, can you go and look online using Perplexity and Research? The hours for the downtown Nashville location for Hattie Bees. For me today, please. All right. And so right here is, like, this little chat interface that we have. Let me zoom out just a little bit so I can resize some of this stuff. Also, for all the OCD people out there, they have this little button right here. You can click this. And it tidies up your little board up here, which is always useful to just keep things organized. And then right here. Like, this is the little chat interface I just made, or I mean, or connected for this agent to be able to chat to. It kind of like chat GPT or something. And it responds back here. But over here on this side, I can see, like, the logs and stuff of what it did. So it's like the. Agent then logged into Mint. It's little short term memory of like what it did. It then called the deep SEQ model right here through the open router node and then it recorded something else to memory and then it responded back to me over here. And then it answered my question. And so it doesn't even look like it hit the Perplexity model. Let me see. I understand. Checking their official website, okay? You're connected to the Perplexity Tool. Are you able to use that to research online, please? Let me see. Just because I. This is just set up as a goofy model. Yeah, you're absolutely right. I do have access to Perplexity Tool. Let me search using the current hours, but it's still not wanting to do it. Okay, so it says that, like, I know you see it, but for some reason, you're actually pinging the tool. So you'll need to ping the tool to research online. And this is because this is like a little demo thing I was playing with earlier. It's not a part of this. It's not. There we go. It's trying to send it to Perplexity now, But now, I didn't have the Perplexity note set up right, but I think you'll kind of get the gist of this, at least of, like, you can even see how the different components underneath this agent are working. And the wild thing about this is, like, This is all running on the API layer. So this is about as secure as you can get. And you're essentially like, rebuilding the functionality of what happens underneath the hood to some extent on the Chat GPT consumer tool or the CLAUDE consumer tool. Like, in their background, they have agents and all these different, like, sub tools. That are connected to them. And, like, that's what y'all are learning to build and put back together in here. Having Claude help you do, rather.  \
Them: And, well, and that's why even in 8N, when you're trying to make that connection to the different AI model, It either knew or it. It was like, okay, here's the API, or you don't have it, you need to get it where. Whereas I had already added open router in my credentials section, which is where I now see that at least the setup that you have will be set up enough that we just go. Through these nodes and. And where it asks for the API can put it there instead of trying to.  \
Me: Exactly.  \
Them: Find them all and put them in anything.  \
Me: Exactly. And, like, if you. If you hit up, like, if anyone in Classic hits this and you're trying to get it to set something up for you, You it will, like, get it as far as it can get it. And you can even tell it, like, I want to have you Claude code set this up all the way, if possible. And if you can't, get it as far as you can, and then come back and tell me the parts that I have to do. And exactly how to do it. In, like, easy, step by step, like, how to. And that's where it could come and build. Or. Or, like, assemble the whole workflow and then tell you. Hey, Leah, like, come in here. Click on the open router node that's on the page. There will be a credentials thing going and select your open router account and if you haven't do that, done that yet, create a new credential and then resave it and try it again and then it'll work.  \
Them: Yep.  \
Me: And it can even go test it on your behalf. Like, once you do the setup, you can go back to Claude code and say, hey, I just did it. Can you go check and make sure I did it correctly?  \
Them: Yep.  \
Me: Because of the way this saves in eight in with your credentials. Like Claude can't see your API key once you've set it up in here. But it can go and, like, use them now. Like it has access to be able to go take. Take action in that way.  \
Them: Got it. You totally answered my question, and then suddenly. Last question was, was it the brush button for the OCD folks of us?  \
Me: Y. Es. Yes.  \
Them: Okay. It was a little brush button that was over on the side.  \
Me: That's right. Yeah. I do that all the time. Just because it's like. Yeah. I need it neat and tidy, just to, like, keep everything easy, to know where it's at.  \
Them: Thank you so much.  \
Me: Yeah. Thank you.  \
Them: In the chat.  \
Me: All right.  \
Them: In the chat. I was trying to come up with theme songs. So I'm saying claude code is singing to all lean on me by bell withers.  \
Me: Nice.  \
Them: But you guys should know, we actually do that for our advanced group, like, before they started, because we're really good at the eighth dimension there, and we did this whole, like, Spotify playlist for them. I think we scared them a little in the beginning, but it was fun.  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Them: So, Tyler, let me just double check. I also, like, know that we're way, way, way off time. I think there was one last. We have. We do have a bunch of questions that aren't course specific, so I think I'm going to get Eliana to like, help me with downloading them so that maybe we could tackle them next Friday, because they're to do with like. How would you. What use cases and stuff like that. Let me see if there was one more, like, strictly to do with the. With the course itself. I just want to make sure, like, all of the setup and that kind of questions are. Are answered. I think that's it. From. From, like, directly relating to the course.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: And then, like, people have been saying, okay. Can you guys be really clear exactly what we need to do? Because we have gone to the Milky Way and beyond. In this. In this conversation. Like by Wednesday, okay? So this is what you we want you to guys to do by Wednesday. The first thing for sure is do part one of the homework. Part one of the homework is getting set up. Like, don't even bother trying to think about what part two is yet. Just dedicate the time to, like, doing part one of the homework, which is setting up all of the different tools that we were using, because if you don't have that, you won't be able to do anything. Okay, so that's part one of the homework. That needs to be done. I'm going to give you guys a deadline. By Monday. Because by by Monday, then that gives you time to get part two of the homework done from Monday to Wednesday. If I say, get it done by Wednesday, then you'll be like, oh, I haven't. Excuse me, but I haven't done a part two yet, and it's Wednesday, so I'm giving you guys some Monday to do that. And then by Wednesday to have part two of the homework. So part two of the homework is to be essentially set the foundations for the customer service agent department that you're going to be building. That we're going to take you through in next week from Wednesday. Like Wednesday's teaching class is going to be okay. We have all of these AI Team members. That work for Hattie B's? Remember, we're using the how to be case study. Because imagine trying to do this for your business now. And coming up with all the material. That's why we're giving you the case study. And we are building a customer service AI department for them. That's going to, like, be able to take a very, like, random thing like, hey, my chicken's not cooked, or whatever. And we're going to have all of these different specialists that our AI agents, they're going to work together as a team to help solve a very specific problem, not just trained on. The whole information of the Internet, but trained on Hattie B's. That's important. That's why we're introducing the core concept of the rag, or the knowledge base. So we have the contextual information of Heidi Bees that has all of their policies, their FAQs, their brand voice. Like, how do they talk to customers.  \
Me: Information.  \
Them: All of that so that when an email comes in from a customer that's angry or that's like, hey, I'd like to make an order or whatever, It. This team has the. The context of that information. So part two of the homework is all about setting that up, which means we will be setting up the knowledge base. For Hattie Bees, like, the. The things that are very specific to how to be like, their policies, how do we deal with customer complaints, things like that, our brand voice. And then we're going to also set up another agent, our first agent, which is like the expert agent, which is called Sugar. So Sugar is one of the agents in the workflow as part of the agentic team. There are other team members, but you are going to be so Sugar is going to be the AI version of you. So Sugar is like. Like you just got hired by Haddie B to be a customer service department to work in. Their customer service department, and they're like, hey, Darren or Panda or Jian or Jeffrey or Steve or whatever. Like, here's a job. It'll be, like, cool. But I don't have to do this because I. I know how to build AI Agents. And so you're going to customize Sugar to be essentially like you working for Heidi Bees. So it will have your brand voice. Right. Because the way that you communicate and the way that you work as a customer service representative for that company. Is we're going to be reflected in that agent, and that's why we're getting you to do the echo workflow. So that's why, you know, when you saw, like, the, you know, dropping, you're going to collect, essentially, samples. Of how you write or your Instagram captions or whatever you have access to. Even, like, whatever. Whatever you feel represents your. Your voice. And that will generate a, like, it will go through a big, deep analysis. It's actually very cool. Everybody loves the echo workflow. It will generate an analysis. Of how you speak, like, whether you say y'all or whether you say 8th dimension a lot or whether you say suite or whatever. You know, like your own very nuanced way of communicating. It will give you that whole big, like, analysis, and it will give you a, like, a summary of it. And you're going to take that summary that it gives you and customize your version of sugar so that then it reflects your voice as if you were being hired by Taddy Bees to do their customer service. Department. So that lays out, remember, the knowledge base, which is what is the contextual information. And that, agent, Agent Sugar, is the AI version of you that works for Hattie B's. That is the foundation of our agency department or AI agent department. And when we have these things locked in before Wednesday, then we can add. The other team members. So the other team members are going to come and support. They're going to be the supporting act. They're going to be the other team members that have different specializations that will collaborate in, in this department. So does that make sense for everybody? Do you feel like you are following? And Tyler, how are we, like, going to do, like, make sure they have access to part two of the homework again and stuff like that?  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So that you all do, like. And I saw this, too. Like, someone said, if you drop transcripts or zoom transcripts into there, as long as they're labeled, like, as long as you have, like, any sort of transcript in it, like, at least your name is labeled on your speaking parts, then the echo workflow. Is smart enough to look. And it's. That's also why it's really cool to use transcripts, because it's not just how you speak, it's how you interact amongst other people as well, which is. It makes it even better. So there's. I just saw that one to answer it. But yes, the part 2 stuff is in the repo already. You want to make sure that you have the latest version of the repo, like what we said earlier, because we push some additional instructions and assets into that. And we're sending that in a follow up email as documents as well to Ilana so that that they can get them to you so that you have that in document form too, so you don't have to go looking for it in GitHub. Yeah, so that's. That's what we were talking about at the very beginning of the session. But it might not have, like, made sense quite yet because we hadn't gone all the way down the rabbit hole and that's yet.  \
Them: And. And people are like, this is beginner level. It's kind of like a weird thing because you guys are like teenagers, but you skipped toddlerhood. Kind of skip that phase. You're like. You just went, like, straight. You know, you're kind of there, but. But, yeah, you guys are doing fabulous. You guys are going to be doing fabulous. Yeah. And, like, so, like, I just want to double make sure part one has to be done before Monday. I'm going to be that person that says, like, do your homework. I'm always that person, by the way. Over the weekend. Don't have fun. Do your homework. And then. And then by Wednesday, have part two done, and then you'll be sweet. Like, just have that in your mind. And like I said, Claude is singing to you and saying Lean on Me by Bill Withers.  \
Me: All. Right. I love it.  \
Them: Thank you so much. For another it's just incredibly, incredibly valuable session. I cannot say enough how great you both are. And I just kept singing in the chat. The students are also trying to express it, but there is not enough that we can all say just thank you so much. I love the real time questions by the way being answered with the people coming up. And I agree with, I think it was Gwen that said in the chat, your analogies are really helpful to, you know, help the students wrap their mind around these tools. And also it's really entertaining. So thank you so much. And also, Sarah and Tyler, if you agree, we can continue to use the same form for the students to supplement their questions. Okay, since you agree.  \
Me: Students. Are also. Trying to express. It. Thank. You so much. By the way. Yeah, that would be super helpful. Yeah. Because then we can, like, monitor that even over the weekend. So if y'all get stuck, use this form that Ilana sharing to drop your questions in there, and we'll try and monitor that and answer it as best as we can. And even give you, if we can, a prompt to have. You. You lean on Claude code a little bit to help you out more.  \
Them: Thank you so much. Thank you so much, both of you. Thank you.  \
Me: All. Right. Joel.  \
Them: Enjoy. Enjoy your study time this weekend.  \
Me: Yeah. Y'all have fun. We will. Have a good rest of your Friday, and we'll see you on. We'll see you Monday.  \
Them: Let's see you both in. I'm just going to stay back to show the students where they can find the Monday's lesson and recording. But go ahead and drop off and have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you on Monday.  \
Me: All. Right. Thanks. Bye, all.  \
Them: Bye. Thank you so much. }
