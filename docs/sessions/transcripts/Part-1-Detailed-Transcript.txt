AIM Dec 3
===

Ileana: [00:00:00] Hello everyone. Hello. Hello. See you guys coming in already. Thank you so much for being on time. You guys are the best With that, how are you guys? I wanna see you in the chat and welcome to December. I think I said it in in my sixth message. I cannot believe we are in December already. So happy December.

Welcome to December, and welcome back to AI Mastery. Howdy says Camon. I love that. Howdy to all of you guys as well. Good afternoon, si Chandy for me as well. It's good afternoon, but good morning and good evening to all of you guys. Steve says, I'm so excited for this session. I am excited as well. Excited about this.

Glad to join in live. I'm loving the energy already, everybody. To kick this month off, today, we're gonna begin with something, as you guys are saying, really, really exciting. It's a brand new series, and I say series because we're gonna have four classes with these amazing people, and we're gonna be shifting into one of the most practical [00:01:00] high impact parts of this program, which is using AI agents to build systems that deliver measurable business value.

So in this series, you're gonna learn how to create automations that integrate AI at strategic points inside your workflow. So it's gonna be an enhancement to your systems. You'll be working with N eight N automations, which you already know the base level of, and you're gonna learn where and how to insert AI modules.

And agent steps to generate business value. So this essentially, it's all about designing systems that work reliably, repeatedly, and of course with AI as a force multiplier for your existing processes. And we are so very fortunate to have two incredible teachers leading this series, Sarah and Tyler.

Sarah Davidson is the co-founder of AI Build Lab, and she's the leading voice in AI powered personal branding and human centered design. She has a background in [00:02:00] communication strategy and business development, and she's helped thousands of entrepreneurs scale their influence. She has so much knowledge in the field and she also has so much experience in teaching and training.

She's taught thousands in live workshops. She's educated more than 10,000 people and she has graduated more than thousands ag agentic practitioners. And Sarah is joined by Tyler Fisk, who is a serial entrepreneur. He's a recognized thought leader in AG Agentic ai, and he's a co-founder of AI Build Labs, of course, together with Sarah.

And Tyler has over 20 years of experience turning startups into scalable high growth companies. He has done this over and over again, including growing his very small $72 family business into eight figures. So together Sarah and Tyler bring a powerful combination of strategy, clarity, and hands-on AI agentic expertise and actually their mission.

Really [00:03:00] aligns with what you are all here to looking for in this AI mastery program. And that is to make AI accessible, useful and powerful for people who want to lead with it in the next era. So with that, let's begin. And please join me in giving a big, big, big warm welcome to Sarah Davidson and Tyler Fisk.

Sara: Hey everyone. So great to be here. Thank you Eliana, for that intro. Um, I love the energy in class already. This is so amazing you guys. Um, and Maria, I see you. I feel like we have, um, people that we, uh, kind of know us, so that's pretty cool to, to also walk into. 

Tyler: Yeah, love this. Excited. We have been looking forward to this class, I think ever since we left Europe.

So, uh, where we visited with y'all and did the Mindvalley event there. So this is gonna be a lot of fun. Um, it's gonna be super fast paced too, so y'all feel free to, uh, like drop questions in the chat and we're gonna try and make this [00:04:00] accessible. Our goal is to get everyone to the finish line over the next several weeks, so 

Sara: yeah.

And yeah, our goal, like Tyler said, is to get you guys to the finish line. So even though we're going to go through a lot of things and you guys are gonna learn a lot, your mind's going to be stretched for sure. Um, our goal is to get everybody to the finish line and for the people who know us in the chat, like they know that we, we keep to our word around that.

So even though you, it might feel like we're going through a lot, we have you covered, we're going to be going through a lot of what we're gonna be doing to support you guys to make sure that everybody gets to the finish line. Um, I, I really love the energy and the chat. I feel like you are our people, so I feel very comfortable.

Thank you for that. Um, so Tyler, do you wanna share your screen and we can, uh, kick into things because we have a lot to work through today. 

Tyler: Yeah, there we go. Alright, 

Sara: cool. There you guys, I don't know if you know this, but you're gonna be building a whole entire customer service agentic department. We're actually gonna be building multiple agents that [00:05:00] work together on your behalf to resolve complex customer service issues.

Um, and I wanna also preface this by saying that even though we're saying customer service department, that is just happens to be the vehicle or the use case. That you're gonna be working to, what you're gonna learn with us. You can apply the mental models, the frameworks of what you're gonna learn into anything you want into your business.

I know people are working within companies, people are going and doing AI implementation agencies. People are got their own businesses. So wherever you're coming in from, um, you know, you can take what you learn here and apply it. It's not just customer service department. And we have, we're lucky enough to be given four sessions with you guys.

So Eliana said, please be very clear with everybody what we gonna expect from you. Okay. So let me start by saying that the four sessions, so we've split the actual demo and the doing work into two parts, [00:06:00] right? So today's gonna be all the foundational stuff that you need to build your department. Um, and then, so we're gonna be, you know, going through all of that today and we're gonna walk you through that.

We're gonna hold your hands through the process and even if you are like, you know, if you are watching the demos and things like that, we will follow up with loom videos and material, step-by-step instructions that you guys can follow. Um, beyond the course, you're gonna, guys are gonna have some homework to do.

Friday session is going to be a q and a session and troubleshooting session, and anything goes session, Friday session is all about you. Alright, so Friday session, you are gonna have time to like, you know, go through the, the demos and your homework and get everything set up. And Eliana's gonna also send you a Google form in case you get stuck in case there's something that you need us to troubleshoot.

And you're gonna drop your questions in that form. And then Friday we're going to like walk in and make sure that everybody's all set up, ready to go. And then part two happens [00:07:00] next week on Wednesday where we're gonna pull together the whole entire ag agentic department, the whole entire ag agentic team.

So we're gonna introduce you to them today. Um, and we're gonna set up the foundations today, but next week we're going to put them all together and then you're gonna have that to graduate with. Um, and we'll have a also follow on session beyond that on the following Friday as well, just to help you troubleshoot.

So Tyler, do you wanna introduce ourselves first? I feel like we just really, really kind of like went really down the rabbit hole. 

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. No, no, you're good. Well, I mean, we've got a lot to cover today, so we'll keep our intro short. Ileana did an amazing job. So Sarah Davidson, Tyler Fist. Um, we've been in this space for several years now.

Um, both of us would consider ourselves non-technical in this space. So if you're in this. Class. Um, like our, our big thing we say at AI Build Lab, which is our company, is that we're in the business of possibilities of what this tech now unlocks [00:08:00] is you to be able to build things that you would've never thought possible before.

And even these new methodologies and frameworks that we're gonna be teaching in here takes that up a whole nother level. Uh, so it's gonna be a lot of fun. We come at this from a, an a position of practitioners as well. Uh, so Sarah and I have not just been like theorizing on this stuff. Uh, over the last several years we've been teaching, we've been consulting, we've been building and developing this stuff for live clients, uh, from small main street businesses all the way up to Fortune 50 companies and everything in between.

So we say that because a lot of what we're gonna walk you through is gonna feel very practical, and it's our goal to make this accessible and to show you that it is possible. Mm-hmm. Because both of us, um, and it's very common, even in our community, we see it. People suffer from imposter syndrome, especially in this tech.

And like, we want to normalize that and say, Hey, ask the questions. We're here to help you. And I promise you that you're gonna get there. [00:09:00] You just gotta keep trying, keep showing up on this stuff. 

Sara: Yeah, for sure. And also, you should also know that 90% of the students who come through our programs are not technical.

I'm not technical. And I teach this stuff, I build this stuff. We have clients all across the board, so we also wanna normalize that you're gonna learn a lot. And if you feel like you don't belong in the room, I promise you, you belong in the room. And we always deliver on our promise, which is we we're gonna get everybody to the finish line and people who, uh, know us in the chat know that to be true about us.

Um, and don't worry for the people who are like, I wish I had more time. And, uh, in between sessions and things like that, like, we are here to make sure you get to the finish line. So we will, you know, extend our sessions and things like that on like Fridays to make sure that you get there. We're committed to that.

Um, so by the end of these two sessions. Monday, the Friday and the sessions and, uh, both Mondays and Fridays, no, sorry, Wednesdays and Fridays guys, um, you will have a working [00:10:00] AI agent, customer service department. Um, but the real skill that you're gonna be using is using AI to build AI systems. We are gonna take this to a very different level where instead of getting bogged down by the tooling and having to figure out, oh my gosh, I've gotta learn this new tool.

And oh my gosh, is it N eight N today and is it Lindy tomorrow? And is it like all these different things we are going to actually take you to ad I, I saw Marie put that in the chat. Marie obviously knows us of the eighth dimension and we're gonna get AI to build the system for us. What you're gonna learn is how to describe what you want.

And so, and getting the AI to build the system for you. So imagine what kind of possibility that that app opens up for you. Especially if you're someone like me who's not technical, who go, who goes, oh my gosh, look at all these squiggly lines. Right? Um, imagine what can that impact on your business on the way that you [00:11:00] work?

All of it. What becomes possible for you if you can literally speak things into existence by knowing how to like, ask for something and having the AI system created for you. So that is where our aim is to get you guys to. And, um, Tyler, if you wanna go to the next slide. Tyler's driving the slides today because we have quite a few demos.

And so, uh, instead of us going backwards and forwards between screen shares, he's doing this, driving the slides and the demo. Um, and any of your questions that do come up, guys, um, just put them in the chat. I will because it's today is very demo heavy. This is what's gonna happen if you ask a question and I feel like we already know we're gonna answer it down the track.

I won't interrupt the flow if it is relevant and if I think a lot of people are getting stuck, like, what the heck's a repo? Okay, we're gonna stop and we're gonna explain that and then we'll, I'm gonna also screenshot everything and make sure that I have [00:12:00] the questions covered in the end. 'cause we're gonna have some, uh, questions at the end time.

So what you're gonna learn today, the whole customer, the ENT department that you're, you're gonna be building, we actually, we teach this in an highly intensive course. Mar knows this in four weeks, okay? You are gonna learn it in essentially four sessions, two sessions, if you think about the theory and then application and things like that.

And because we wanted you guys to, like, that's the amount of time we have together. Um, and we knew that was really important for you guys to have something that you, you, it's tangible for you that you can use and deploy in your own work. What we have done. Is we have built the architecture. So we have built the infrastructure.

So instead of you doing like coming with us in four weeks and learning, oh, the prompt engineering and then writing the system instructions and building the agents and learning parameters and learning all the things that will get you to the full agenda department of four weeks, we've [00:13:00] built the infrastructure for that.

So you guys can just leverage the infrastructure as in we've built all of that stuff that you need to know or do, and then you guys can leverage that to actually, uh, essentially speak into, uh, the workflow into existence. But there is a place that we need to get you there for you to be able to do that.

Yeah. And ev and everything that you learn around that, the templates and everything like that, you can keep and customize to other workflows for your work down the track as well. Tyler, do you wanna mention anything about that? 

Tyler: Yeah, I was gonna say too, like I, I know like even hearing the fact of wow, y'all have con condensed four week curriculum into a couple of teaching sessions is that I even saw people were like, is that even possible?

Uh, well we're gonna, we're gonna figure this out. Um, mainly Sr was saying the way that we've built this and the approach that we're teaching this in here, where you're gonna become more of an orchestrator of agents, which is different. This is like what we have been teaching over the last like year plus taken to the [00:14:00] next level and using new tools to actually do this work.

So it's gonna be a lot of fun. Um, and I think it's gonna be possible too, just because of what we're gonna be using. Uh, the system and the methodology of cloud code and VS. Code and, um, Claude Desktop to get all of this stuff into production, into N eight N. It is not only gonna help you and educate you along the way, but it'll help you actually set up and build all this stuff.

Yeah. Which is, is pretty wild. It's, so a lot of what we're gonna be doing today here in a minute is going to be around the, the setup for sure. 

Sara: And, and, and Tyler, do you wanna make a quick, um, message about the setup? 'cause I know some people might have gone through that process and some people might not have and that's totally okay.

So we just wanna validate that. Do you wanna mention something Tyler, about that? 

Tyler: Yeah. So here in a minute, like there was some emails that, uh, Eliana and the Mindvalley team, I think sent out that were telling y'all some of the different things you wanted to try and have set up and installed or ready coming into [00:15:00] today's session.

Um, again, we're gonna go through it all again step by step today. It's gonna be fast because of time. We're gonna shoot a Loom video after this class to make sure we cover any questions and do it again so you can watch it again in a different, um, like format of end-to-end walkthrough there. And we have Friday as well to answer any questions and then unblock anyone here.

Because once you get this initial, it's almost like Saara describes it as once we get the workshop set up of like all of these tools that we need to build the, the bots to build the agents. Um, like then the system is designed to help you along the way, uh, to help like move it along no matter where you're, you're at in your understanding of this stuff, you can just talk to it in plain language and it'll help you keep moving forward.

Sara: And I think someone asked like, but can we actually understand what's happening behind the scenes? And yeah, we're gonna take you through that so that you, that is super important. We don't want you just clicking a button and [00:16:00] not understanding why something is being built, because we want you to know how things work behind the scenes so that you have a real clear understanding of what good looks like.

So that's part of what we're gonna be doing. So we assume, 'cause we've just like, we're the new kids on the block, right? That in your mastery journey so far that you've learned about prompt engineering, context engineering, you've learned about parameters like temperature. Don't worry about if you, if this sounds like a little bit foreign, you can still do this without it.

You've been probably working with AI assistance and some basic N eight N stuff and today we're gonna introduce you to new terms. Okay? Um, that it's gonna be important for you to understand how to build. An agent department, a whole entire AI department that does things for you. So the first key thing for you to know is that we are going from a, from an assistant to agent.

An assistant is like chat GPT. You know, it doesn't work until you actually instructed it to work, but if you're not part of the [00:17:00] process, nothing happens. An agent is kind of like having an AI employee that can reason, plan and execute on your behalf. And the very cool thing is that you can build an entire team of agents that act like a department, like exactly like a customer service department.

So Bob knows what's happening with Jim and they can collaborate and they can figure out, oh, this customer's pissed. Let's send this message. Or they ask for this information, let's find the right information. So they collaborate like an entire team. Okay. And in order for them to know what, what they're working on and what is relevant to your business, we are also introducing this concept to you called retrieval augmented generation, which is just a, a fancy word for essentially creating a knowledge base.

So AI has access to all the information in the world, but it doesn't have context on your own business, on your policies, your procedures, all of that. So as part of this [00:18:00] process, we're gonna teach these agents or teach ai. Um, what about your company? So that, when. You get a customer service email or whatever, it generates the information that is relevant to your company.

Um, we also teach about human in the loop. This is a very important part of our philosophy around this, is because you are building an entire team where you're giving these agents the ability to be like, um, to have autonomy, to act on your behalf. You wanna have, um, ensure assurance that you are approving the tasks that it does for you.

So we always have this like human checkpoint in the process and you build that level of, uh, confidence in the system over time. You don't just like, Hey, let's just like chuck an agent out in the wild and hope for the best. That's not how we roll. Um, we might hear us talk about orchestration or like building an orchestrated agent workflow, and that's [00:19:00] essentially when you have multiple agents acting and collaborating together.

So they're working together like a department, like a team, like a task force that is the orchestration. And I'm sure you've probably come across mcps, but these are essentially like, uh, the API for those of you who are more technical, but giving the agents like superpowers to access tools and data and information to be able to go and execute on your behalf.

Right. So, Tyler, is there anything that you wanna add to it? 

Tyler: No, that, this is awesome. Thank you. Um, like we're, we're trying to, to set the. Glossary of terms that you're gonna hear us say, but at any time as we go through this stuff, if y'all hear us say a phrase or some sort of a term and you don't know what that means, please like drop that into the chat.

We're trying to detect bro this stuff as best as we can and make it, uh, understandable. So sweet. All right. 

Sara: So what we're gonna do, okay, I think that you guys get the vision. So I'm gonna go through it pretty quickly about what you're gonna be building, [00:20:00] but we're gonna go into the demo. We want you guys to see the end project in action, right?

And then we're gonna deconstruct backwards. We're gonna go, okay, let's, now that we've seen how these agents collaborate and work together as a department, let's, uh, set up the workshop, right? Let's get you guys set up and we'll go through it. And like I said, um, this is gonna be pretty fast because we're live, but we will send out a Loom video with more detailed step by steps after, after the session for you guys to follow with instructions.

We very much like hold your hand through your, through the process, and then we're gonna demo the building the brain. So this is the knowledge base that's gonna provide the expert advice or the expertise on your business. And we wanna make sure that your customer service department doesn't sound like ai, like a robot, it sounds like your brand, right?

So we're gonna show you how to do that. We're gonna provide all of the tooling around that. And then we're gonna give you, um, some homework to [00:21:00] do so that you can put, start putting the foundations together and then you're ready for week two, which is when we're gonna build the entire department. Okay.

Alright. So we, okay. We're chosen random shop to demo. Not that 

Tyler: random. It is like AI and chicken. So that's for me, and like, it's Nashville. So like, I'm from Tennessee, y'all, and this is one of my favorite restaurants, so it's sort of random, but yeah. 

Sara: All right. Okay. So what is happening is that we're, we are building a customer service department for Hatty Bees as a case study to show you guys, okay?

This is an incredibly advanced thing that your guys are gonna do. And so what we want you to do is actually go through the reps with us already providing you with the, in the information, the infrastructure and everything, okay? So we want you, we wanna give you a real world example, not just a made up, right?

So you, you can see exactly how the pieces fit together, and [00:22:00] then we want you to do, to do the reps. So once you go through the whole step-by-step process of how you do it for a business, then you can customize it to your own business, your own, or any other use case. It doesn't have to be customer service, but it's really, really important that you guys have the scaffolding, the infrastructure to help you go through and get the reps.

And then you can take it wherever you guys wanna go. So, high DBS is gonna be our, uh, case study. And you'll get to know them a little bit. Do you wanna mention anything about how to bees Tyler? I don't know. 

Tyler: Yeah, I mean, they're, they started as like a small Nashville hot chicken joint, um, a and now they have locations all over the country.

I freaking love them. They're amazing. So if you ever have the chance, like definitely eat them or eat them, eat with them, uh, check 'em out. The, the vibe is also really cool. Plus what we're building here is like, congratulations, all of y'all picked up this second side gig of working as a customer service rep or an internal team member on the Hattie Bs team during this course to try [00:23:00] and think about how would I build this stuff?

And, and because like, we don't have all their internal information. 'cause this is just a case study, right? Like all of the information that we used to build this is publicly accessible. So even the fact of where we're able to get this thing to with just that is, is pretty wild. Uh, and like when we're saying that we want all of us to be singing to the same hymnal here, here and like all working to the same case study, that helps us get the build repetition.

We have a, a strong belief that it's, it's easier to pick this stuff up and learn by building and learning that through like repetition. I personally am like a very kinetic, uh, type learner. That's one of the best ways that I pick things up. And so that's, that's the same kind of way that we teach here.

Yeah. The 

other thing is, is like everything that you're building in here, you're getting this in a repo and you're gonna learn the process to do this. And you'll, this will make more sense to you, like probably in a maybe next week, but this is creating [00:24:00] an entire system level shot prompt example. And what that means is like once you build this thing out, end to end, you now have that to use this methodology of giving it to Claude code, giving it the desk, like the Claude Desktop app to be like, Hey, here's an example of an ag agentic like set of ag agentic workflows that we built.

I want you to look at this to use it as inspiration, and then go build this completely new workflow for me and it can look at how we put this together and learn from that to build something net new. Yeah, which is a lot of fun. 

Sara: Okay, I wanna cover, look, there's a lot of confusion around reps. Thanks guys.

Anytime and doesn't make sense. Just say it because we are like, we're in our own zones. Okay. When I, we say we want you to get the reps on hadie bees, it means we want you to practice the repetition of what it's like to build a customer service department for hat bees. We want you to go through the step-by-step process without giving you the [00:25:00] like, your mind will be blown if you have to do this and contextualize it to your business out the gate.

We want this to be easy for you, so we want you to go through the motions. Of going through this step-by-step with us on a, a case study. And then once you've had the repetitions and you're confident with the process, you can apply it and take it wherever you you wanna take it to. Okay. So that's the, that's, um, on reps and I'm sure we mentioned repo.

You will hear us say repo over and over again. Probably Tyler's gonna say it more than me, repo. Think of it as like a shared Google drive, which has got like, all this information for building stuff. Okay? So that's what a repo is. Um, so yeah, do check us on the terminology because, um, sometimes we're just in our own heads.

So the ra the roadmap for how we're gonna do this. Okay, this session is about getting the workshop set up. We're gonna get everything set up that we need to be able to build this agent department to be able to build these AI employees. [00:26:00] And as, um, a baseline, we're gonna build an, an AI employee, like an expert say, that is trained on the hadie B business.

Remember how we said we need, we need a customer service department, but for Heidi Bs, not for all of the information on the internet, for Hadie Bs, for their policies, for their procedures, for their brand voice, how they do things, right? And we're gonna teach the AI employee, we're gonna train it on the information.

So we're gonna connect it to a brain or the knowledge base, and we're gonna make sure that it reflects. Um, the, the hat B brand voice. So your company brand voice, think about it that way. And your own brand voice as if you are, you were a customer service representative working for hat B's, but we're creating the AI version of you.

Okay? So that's session one, is we're gonna set up the employee, the, the kind of workshop. We're gonna get everything put together. And then next week we're gonna go into building the other team [00:27:00] members and the departments. And we're gonna pull them all together in a workflow. Like they're gonna collaborate together and they're gonna be exactly like you see people, if they're like in a department like, Hey Bob, we just got this, like, angry email from someone.

Or the chicken's like not cooked or whatever, right? And so we have to go and then it passes the information on to Sue, Sue goes and checks the knowledge base. She makes sure that we're, how we're gonna respond, responds in the right way. So that, that's the kind of idea. And we're gonna go through the team, uh, in, in a minute.

Um, so the, this is the agent team that you're gonna be building, okay? So, um, we like to be a little bit, if you probably figure it out, we're pretty casual about this. You're gonna hear us, people say, don't anthropomorphize ai. Like they, they're all just like, no, don't make, AI is not human. Okay? We're gonna be the people who do that because it honestly makes the most sense.

You will, you will understand the [00:28:00] process. Um, that when we like think through how we hire people, what information we give them, how we, uh, measure their performance, it is kind of like having a team member for sure. Okay. And we like to have fun with it. So our agents have funny names. Um, and so the, the agents that we're gonna be working with today, Tyler, do you wanna actually introduce the agents?

'cause I feel like I've been talking a lot. 

Tyler: Yeah, sure. No, I got you. Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah. So like, like so said, like, all of these agents, they have fun names. Like we will, I'll tell, give you the background and then also kind of like give the bucket of what that kind of agent is. Um, cinnamon is the quick funny story about that is because of my accent, I'm from the south.

When I say sentiment analysis and if I don't annunciate really well and it gets transcribed, it frequently comes out as cinnamon. Uh, and so I, I'm also a Big Bang theory, like that TV show, a huge fan of that show. 'cause I'm a nerd. And Raj on that show, um, [00:29:00] has a little dog and his dog's name is Cinnamon.

And every time he, he calls the dog, he's like, cinnamon. So I'm like, that is the name for my sentiment analysis agent. And that's what y'all get too. So this is like, think about this as an email comes in because we're building this customer service email workflow. If a person was doing this, we would read that email and we would vibe check it, right?

We would be trying to understand what's the emotions conveyed, what are they not saying? But we can kind of read between the lines on all of that sort of stuff. That's what Cinon is doing, and you're gonna get that agent as a part of this. Um, really quick, I saw, uh, Elena, you had your hand up or raised up.

I wanna make sure that we get you real quick for we keep going if you just wanna unmute and ask. I think if you're able to on here, 

Ileana: so they're not able to unmute, uh, Tyler and Sarah. Okay. But we can promote people as panelists if you like, but you can invite 'em for something quick to share in the chat.

Sara: Yeah, I was gonna say, I, the questions probably, um, it may be [00:30:00] easier if I filter the questions to you, Tyler, 

Tyler: that, that, that works. I just saw it like pop up. That's why I wanted to flag that. So yeah, if y'all just wanna drop 'em in chat right now if you can, and then we will, we'll address 'em, um, as we keep going.

So the, I'll just keep working on the roster here. Okay. Hatch is just like a fun branding name because hot chicken and hatch, like, I think you guys can connect the dots there. That's our expert agent. The expert agent is like, think of this as when you get an email coming in and like in a lot of businesses it's not always the customer service rep that knows the answer to the question.

They might have to go check in with some other people on their team. To get all the information they need to then go back or, or check a knowledge base or check FAQs or, or something like that, to then go back and answer or, or write that email. So in the same way that, uh, you might see that play out in the real world, we have a separation of duties here in the, the agents here [00:31:00] also.

So Hatch is our all things Hattie B's expert. And it is also connected to another little agent, which we'll talk about more here in a minute, called the Librarian. So the librarian houses all of the information and Hattie B's knowledge base. So Hatch has its own expertise and uh, an email comes in, send Emon, does the sentiment analysis, vibe check it passes that over to Hatch.

Hatch is the expert. It's looking at the email, it knows it's not talking to the customer, it's working amongst the AI team. It looks, or it sends a message to the librarian agent to be like, Hey, here's what I'm thinking. Someone asked about like, do we have gluten-free options on the menu, librarian, can you go check through our, our knowledge base to double check and give me back anything that would be helpful for me to answer this and pass on down the line.

And then it does that and it hands it over to sugar. So sugar is like, you know, the, the, uh, [00:32:00] stereotypical like southern hay, sugar, like, uh, waitress. Basically that's the persona that we built into here. This is our email copywriting agent. So think of this like we, we built this from a template that we use frequently called you've got mail, and it's made to be a really good customer service email agent.

And so when it gets the information from Cinon and from the expert agent, hash sugar then thinks about this, writes that accessible, empathetic on brand at the brand level voice. And even at you as like a person. If you want it to sound like, if I wanted it to sound like me, Tyler, working as an employee for Hattie Bs, I, I could do that and I could bake that brand voice into the sugar agent if I wanted to.

So that's what's happening there. Uh, Bishop, the name on that is the, the Bishop family. They're the ones who launched and founded Hattie be. So, uh, you're gonna find out that we have this framework called the Toast Method, which we'll touch on here in a [00:33:00] minute. And that involves using evaluations or evals.

And the bishop agent is the boss agent. In this sense, it's not necessarily the total boss, but it's like the quality control agent. It looks at the work that the other agents have done to this point, and it's either gonna rubber stamp it. Uh, and say, yep, that's good. Or call out what it's done well, what it's done wrong, and then it's going to pass that back to the sugar agent to like revise something.

And then the last one is gonna be the, the holler agent. Um, probably just 'cause if I say that word, it sounds funny and it's like holler, like it's, it's hollering at you over in Slack to let us know. The people know because, uh, we, that's the agent we would be interacting with. So the experience of when this agentic team works together is a new email hits the Hattie Bs email, um, customer service email.

Sara: I think that's the next slide, Tyler. Okay, cool. It shows, yeah, I think it shows the, yeah, we, yeah. There we go. 

Tyler: There we go. Thank you. Yeah, so [00:34:00] there's an incoming email. Cinon looks at it and is like, what's the temperature, the sense of it analysis. It does the full five check. It then is gonna pass it to the expert agent, which is the hatch agent.

And it's like, what do we know about this? What, what do I know in my expertise? And what do we have in our knowledge base that I can go and grab to help pass forward to the sugar agent that is going to write the customer email? So it's the one that's actually gonna do that copywriting. It writes the V one version of the email.

It doesn't know that it's writing the V one version. It thinks that it's going ahead and responding back to the customer. But it's, it's V one version then gets passed to the bishop agent, which is the quality assurance agent. And it's going through an entire rubric going like, Hey, is this, is this good enough?

Um, what did it do right? What did it do wrong? Is it ready to go ahead and send, or are there revisions that need to be made? And it might send it back to the sugar agent to do some more work. Once we get to a finalized, like rubber stamped [00:35:00] version, it then sends it to the hauler agent. The hauler agent then looks at all of this and pings us in Slack.

So if, if I work for Hattie B's, I don't have to be checking my inbox anymore. I have a whole AI team that's doing that. It's reasoning through it, it's writing the email, and then it sends me a message in Slack and it's like, Hey Tyler, here's an email that we just got. Here's how the team thought about it.

Here's the draft that we wrote. Does this sound good to you and or not? Or is there some changes you want us to make? And holler has a really fun personality. So it, it's almost like an executive assistant coming in and doing this, but with swagger. Um, 

Sara: yeah. And, oh, sorry. Did you? 

Tyler: No, you're good. And then, and then I was gonna say like, and then we just talk to it like a person in Slack, like a team member and are like, yeah, that's great.

Please go ahead and just send it on. We don't have to use any special phrases, we just talk to it. Um, or if there's an edit or a revision that we want to have made, we just tell it that. And then we will go back and revise [00:36:00] it and bring it back again in like this feedback loop right here. But ultimately it's able to then go take action on our behalf.

But holler coming into slack. Slack is what we call a human in the loop checkpoint. That is such a big deal. If we did not have this in place and have it with a check-in, especially at the beginning of a workflow that we build, then all of these agents could just do their work and then auto send it back to the customer without any oversight.

And that is a recipe for disaster. You have to work your way up to that level of agency and you're gonna get there. But this human, a loop checkpoint is a huge reason that you'll, you will have success if you implement that versus like, if, if you've seen the, the writeups about that of like, um, a lot of AI projects have failed and I have a lot of theories about that, but this is one of them.

It's like they're not doing this. 

Sara: AI agents gone rogue, basically. You got it. Um, and to answer a few of your questions. Okay. So I, I still, I love the energy and the [00:37:00] excitement. Keep that going. Um, so there's a few questions like, Hey, why don't you just build one agent that does everything because you're not gonna get the level of depth and specialization that you really need to make this function.

Like in a whole agent team in the same way, like if you had a customer service department, right. And it was a large customer service department, or it was like a marketing, I'm gonna go outside of customer service, just so you know. Right. So if you had a whole big initiative, right. And you had a task force.

You would like, you having a different number of specialists who are specialized in different things that know different things, that are specialized in different things that can actually bring in their specializations to help solve a problem, versus one person who just like knows everything. Right? But in saying that, okay, so often you guys are asking advanced questions here, so we'll go there.

But, um, when Tyler and I built a Gentech workflows in the same way that when you have a big initiative, right, and you can [00:38:00] hire all these specialists, they can all know their job, but it could be chaos. If they don't, they're not coordinated. So often we have a boss agent we call a router agent that actually like, manages the agents and divs up the tasks and checks on quality control and make sure that all the agents are doing their jobs and we're getting the thing delivered.

So it might feel like in some cases that you are, you are just working with one boss agent, but that boss agent has an entire team working under it, under it that it's coordinating with. So, um. That's why we do like the specializations and then the boss agent. Um, but um, and then I think the second question was around like, does this work outside of Slack?

Yes. Slack just happens to be for this demo as our com like the way that we've built this to be communicated to, but you can build it however you want. Like it can be Gmail or like SMS notification I guess, or [00:39:00] whatever if as long as you have Yeah. Mi 

Tyler: Microsoft Teams or, yeah, so like we, we had to pick a stack to teach to.

Right. But, but think of these as like modular components that could be swapped out and Yeah, you could use WhatsApp. Um, or like, there's all sorts of different, like all of these modular pieces you could swap with your personal preference. And I, I would suggest like, just to make it easy on yourself, like use the stack that we've picked for class to just try and build with that if possible.

Um, and then after the fact, you could think about how would you adapt that to your own, like, tech stack after that? 

Yeah. 

Um, and, and then also like Sarah went into router and orchestration mode just to kind of level set of what we're gonna be building and where you can take it from here. Uh, we're gonna be getting this to a point where it gets to production and we have the human in the loop checkpoint.

Like we couldn't condense like all of the advanced stuff of like where you would take this to after that. But building an orchestration agent, a full evals [00:40:00] database that runs evaluations, even agents that watch the agents and do a continuous feedback loop to self-improve the system is possible. And that's what I was alluding to when I was saying like, once you get it to this point, you can scale that level of agency, but just for the scope of this class, we're gonna get it like, up to that point, but not to not, not going beyond that, I guess is the best way to put it.

Sara: Yeah. I have a whole bunch of like private q and a questions. Uh, like, so yes. The, the mechanism, like the SMS WhatsApp Messenger phone, yes. You can even have a phone agent call you. It's, it's like it can work, whatever. As long as you can connect the text piece pieces. Right. That's the, the, the pieces that need to make it work.

Mm-hmm. Um, and um, in terms of holler, holler doesn't send the email it sends you, first of all it's, it kind of does a, a check with you. So it like goes, okay, the whole team, so we got a really pissed customer because chicken wasn't cooked or [00:41:00] something. Don't sue me. Like I'm just coming up with a hard like example.

Right. And then we wanna make sure that we like are managing that situation, right, because it could be a whole PR disaster. Right. So then the whole team will go and do the thinking and do the, like, this is how we need to respond. These are our policies, this is our brand voice. Hauler brings it to you and say, Hey, is this a great, is like, is this an adequate response?

Is this correct? Do we wanna change anything? And you and that. And then you are the check to then send that, uh, out to the customer to get the agent team to send that to the the customer. 

Tyler: Yes. And then like, if, if you approve it, the hauler agent will go and, and actually like release or, or send the email on your behalf via like Gmail is what we're gonna be building this in.

But a again, that could be swapped for Outlook or, or whatever you use for email provider there. Um, but yes, it is, it is the checkpoint. It's the interactive agent that you're gonna be working with. 

Sara: Yeah. And while Tyler's pulling up the demo, um, I will answer a question [00:42:00] about like, it would be great to have a dashboard metrics, KPI as well to track performance.

Yes. We are like, we can't fit that whole big, like that's a whole entire course on evaluating your agent's performance. Um, but yes, that is part of like if you have kind of like you have a people team, right? You have KPIs, you are like, Hey, Bob's like scored a three out of five in his response, why is not a five out of five?

Let's coach Bob on how, what five out five looks like. So that's called evals evaluation process. Uh, so that is what we do. Um, and to answer your question, um, but that's not like what we can teach to in like. Yeah. Two sessions 

Tyler: in a short amount of time. Yeah. All right, so let's come in here and let's look underneath the hood, um, so we have a sense of like what we're trying to build to in here.

So can everybody, sorry. Can you see Arc browser and CDN eight N on my screen share now? Well, there we go. Fireworks. 

Sara: Whoa. Um, I can [00:43:00] see NA nm. Yeah. 

Tyler: Alright, cool. Alright, so this right here, this is gonna be the NAN cloud version. This is where we're going to deploy all of these agents and ag agentic workflows to here in a minute.

Um, or, or, or over the coming, uh, days, I should say. And so quickly, I want just like, walk through how all of this works. So the actual email system itself is going to look, oh, 

Sara: Tyler, can you make it a little bit bigger or not? 

Tyler: Yeah. Let's see. Is, 

Sara: uh, 

Tyler: crap. Hold on. All right. Can we see that better now? Mm-hmm.

Hopefully. Okay. All right. So when an email comes in, uh, like we need to have what I like to call a, a generative filter. This is an email classification filter. And so in my example that I have like built out and already set up on my account, this is watching my Tyler AI build lab email in Gmail.

Obviously it's not Hattie B's, but if I send an email in [00:44:00] here and it determines through this AI classification system that it is a customer service email for Hattie Bs, it will tag it as such. Log it in Google sheets so that we have record keeping, uh, all along the way. And then it determines, you know, what's the customer's email.

If it was, it sends it on to the cinon agent to get it over into the actual email pipeline. The reason for doing this is that like, even if this was the actual Hattie B's email inbox that we were hooking this up to, they might get things like newsletters or spam or all of that sort of stuff that hits their inbox or just like an internal email, let's say.

And they don't want this AI agent team firing off on that A because like they, they're not, we're putting boundaries around like what they can answer and what they can't answer. And, um, like we, we wanna save tokens, right? Like every time these workflows run, they cost us money in AI credits. And so [00:45:00] we wanna make sure that we're being diligent about that too.

So this first, this is like the first step in the process. A new email comes in, it hits this generative filter. And we can get into this more, um, a little bit later if like, people have questions, but I just wanna go through it quickly now. It pulls the email, it parses it in, it logs it, it classifies it as the type of email, and then it's going to, like, if it passes the test, it'll send it on over to Emon and that will then kick over to the AI agent team.

The next thing that's gonna happen is this. This is the, and this is a big workflow, so I'm gonna to zoom in a little bit tighter here. Um. This is like the second part of the process. So if it passes, go on that generative filter, it then brings all that information over into this agentic workflow where we're gonna set some different parameters at the beginning of this innate end process.

It's gonna go back and actually tag the email as in process in Gmail so that we can keep, uh, a tracking [00:46:00] system in Gmail too, of like where an email might be in this pipeline. It feeds it to our cinema agent to do the sentiment analysis. It then takes that and passes it over to Hatch. Hatch is gonna be connected to both the, uh, uh, short term memory, the librarian, which is the rag database, and it's even gonna have EXAA web research tool over here that it's gonna be able to search on.

It then takes that information. All of that gets passed over to Sugar. Sugar Is our email copywriting agents the one that's gonna actually write the email? Sorry 

Sara: to, just to cut your flow, but can you collapse a sidebar just so that people can see? Yeah. 

Tyler: Yep. Thank you. There we go. Sorry. Uh, yeah, so then it's like sugar is gonna write the actual email.

It then is going to take it and pass it over to Bishop and again, it, it like updates the tag in Gmail of where it is in the status. Bishop then does QA on it to determine, you know, is this good? Does it need revisions or not? And then we kind of hit this fork in the road. If it passes QA [00:47:00] and it's good to go ahead and, and move forward, it goes ahead and prepares it for store and sends it down this upper path.

If QA is needed, it then sends it back to the sugar agent for revision. The revision is marked as complete. Bishop reviews it one more time and then, uh, we then determine if it passes the second QA or not. And then it's tagging it as if it was approved. It logs it into Google Sheets and we tell, holler about it, holler now pings us in Slack and lets us know.

So I I, I know I'm like moving through this quick. There's a lot of moving parts and there's some nodes. I'm not even going through here, uh, at this stage, but I just kind of wanna like y'all see the general flow of this. And the other thing I want to call out is that I did not have to build this system.

And this is like what you all are gonna learn. I in, I laid out what I wanted to happen and I documented that really well. That's what we're gonna do when we get into cloud code and vs code here in a minute. And then that [00:48:00] system built this for me. So it puts together, it can even go and build this, edit it, update it, ship it in to N eight N on my behalf.

So that's what we're saying, like you're gonna be able to put together a really complex workflow, even like this. With, with almost very little knowledge of how N eight N works yet. Like you don't have to, it removes that friction in here, which is kind of the amazing part. 

Sara: Yeah. And that's like we wanted to show you behind the scenes.

Um, and, and like we're also saying that in order for you to get there, there is a setup that's required. We are, we've done all of the like, infrastructure pieces that make this possible, but you have to get, uh, set up in the right way so you can use the infrastructure in the way that we're describing. 

Tyler: Yep.

Okay. So, so at, at this like point in the agent flows. 'cause as you can see, like this is a system, there's a lot of components in here, uh, and there's a lot of moving parts. So at this stage, [00:49:00] the agents would've gotten the email, it would've passed go. They would've thought about it, written it, holler, would've now pinged us over in Slack.

We would've then, like if we time block and say we want to go answer emails, you know, in the morning and the evening, we go back in Slack and look at all of our holler messages and begin to respond to them and say, yep, this looks good. Go ahead and send this email. Nope. Uh, like this one needs this revision.

Please do that and then bring it back to me to actually make that happen. We have another generative filter here. This is like the workflow, two of this where when we respond in Slack, that comes back over here to an intent classifier type agent that understands. Did we say in plain language that yeah, this is good to go ahead and send on via Gmail, or did we say that we wanted some sort of revision done or is it coming back and it read it got this, this workflow was triggered by some sort of a confirmation message coming back from the hauler agent.

These are like the different paths it could see. And if [00:50:00] so, it's routing it back to different workflows. Like if it determined that we said, yep, go ahead and send it, it'll actually go ahead and send that email for us or respond to that email for us in Gmail, update all of this stuff in Google Sheets and then ping us back in Slack to confirm and say, Hey, I just wanna let you know we went ahead and sent that email for you and it's done.

If we did a revision, it sends it to a different workflow that that does a sub routine, that does a, a revision on that and sends it back to us in Slack again from the hauler agent. And if it is a confirmation step where it recognizes that it was just the hauler agent telling us, Hey, I sent you that email and we're good to go, that could potentially also trigger this workflow.

And so we need to account for that. It basically will just like gracefully kill the flow and not like get into a continuous loop in here. Um, okay. And then another part of this would be, uh, this is like the sub uh, workflow of the [00:51:00] revision. So if we told it that we needed an edit, if we told the hauler agent that it sends it back to this workflow where it goes back to hatch.

Back to Sugar, back to Bishop, and then it sends it back to us in Slack. That's what's happening here. Uh, same thing on, on this librarian tool. This is the agent that is connected as the rag knowledge base agent, uh, that has all of the Hattie Bees information in the Vector stores. Like in the, in the, the AI second brain, if you wanna think of it like that, that is connected to the, to the different, um, like Hatch and, uh, the, the Bishop agent, all of those types of agents, it would ping this workflow to go and look in our Vector store and bring back the response to those agents.

So again, there's like, there's five different workflows just with, with all these different agents and things running underneath the hood that we didn't even necessarily have to come up with that completely. We worked with Claude Code to [00:52:00] help think through and design the system and actually get it put together on our behalf and get it going.

Sara: Yeah. Um, and when you say Vector Store, do you wanna explain a little bit about that? 

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Um, oh, by 

Sara: the way, sorry. Sorry, Tyler. Before you answer that question, we are gonna go a little over, you'll know this no knows this about us, we always go over, but, um, there will be a recording if you have to drop on everything like that.

We just wanna make sure that you guys get everything that you need from us, okay? And we're happy to go over and it's important for you guys to understand. Not just the magic show, but how it's done, why, why the magic show works, what, what is actually happening behind the scenes. So don't worry if you have to drop, we'll still make sure that you guys, uh, get everything that you need.

Tyler: Yeah, so we like, we just really wanted to do this overview and get the onboarding. And then also remember we're gonna have that async loom that we'll send back as well. Um, okay, so this human in the loop system, this is kind of like the production [00:53:00] email flows, right? Like all the different components of that we're gonna go through here in a minute.

Um, how the heck do we even teach AI to sound like us? Like how the heck would we even go about doing that? Well, we have something called the, the Echo agent that is, uh, a brand voice mirror is like how SAR likes to describe it. And what we're going to do, a part of our homework for this week is we're going to create what we call a mega doc, where you're gonna get examples of your communication style.

This could be transcripts, this could be emails, um, all all sorts of different things. And we're gonna come back in here and chuck it into this workflow. It's gonna do a full linguistic analysis. So if we, if we zoom in on this a little bit more, uh, there's a lot of things that are happening, like getting the data sorted and ready to then in parallel, like all firing at the same time.

Each of these are individual AI agent calls. That are doing very specific [00:54:00] analysis of how it is that you communicate so that we can take that and use the output of this to both add into our, our business second brain so that the AI agent Sugar knows how to sound like me if I wanted to, and it's gonna give me a piece of XML.

So a piece of of system instructions for the system, prompt for the agent to go in and update and personalize the sugar agent again, so it knows in the system prompt and in the knowledge base how it needs to emulate how we sound. So instead of it sounding, 

Sara: sorry, when it's, when we say XML, like you don't have to know about coding or whatever.

All it is, it's a syn, it is a snippet with words in it like this, this copy and paste thing that you'll do, it will generate a text and you will copy and paste it and put it in your agent. So that's what we mean by that. Uh, in case you were like, what the heck is that XML? And why do I need to know that?

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. So, we'll, we'll come back to this again here in a minute, but I just wanted to [00:55:00] show this because this is, uh, we're gonna be working on this today to create your analyses and the snippets so that you all can know how to personalize your sugar agent to sound more like you. And then if we come back over here, the last little section is that AI second brain system.

So we're gonna be using the very new and also like exciting like Gemini file search. So when we teach this in our own classes, we teach this in a product called Cassidy ai, and Cassidy makes a lot of this stuff really simple, uh, especially like setting up your own like second Brain or Vector database.

And in eight N it's not quite as easy. Traditionally we would've used something like a tool called Pine Cone or, or, or Super Base or something like that. And, and that is a blocker for a lot of folks because it can be a challenge to get that set up and maintain it. Google Gemini came out with their version of this that is [00:56:00] extremely accessible and it's really cheap.

So I won't go into like all of the, the information on that. Like you guys can go and research that more. And there's even some information in the GitHub repo that you're gonna get about this, that you can chat with your cloud code agent about to learn more about this. But we need to set up all of the infrastructure that will allow us to go through and upload those brand voice analyses, upload the FAQs or the menu or, or website information or all this sort of stuff about Hattie Bs into that, that system so that the agents can access it.

And all of these, uh, workflows that you see in this section of N eight N are basically all of that piping to make that happen and keep it up to date. And the way this will, oh, go ahead. Sorry. 

Sara: Sorry. I thought you were, you were pausing so you can go. 

Tyler: Yeah, so like, and the way this will work, once we all, we get it all the way set up, is you're gonna have two options.

There's going to be [00:57:00] a, a, we can set up a Google Drive hot folder so that, uh, there's a workflow in here that watches it. So anytime you drop a document or a PDF or something like that into that folder, it will automatically go and add it into the Gemini file search in store for you. That's one way. The other way, and this is where like, it's, it's interesting that we can do this, but this right here is a vibe coded ui ux that we've built out that makes this really easy because even though Jim and I Google made this process really simple, it seems like they kind of like half baked some of this stuff because they forgot to build a front end to 'cause to use this, you have to use, you have to kind of be a little bit of a developer to go and do it.

So instead, we made this website right here that you all have, and, uh, we have the process of how we did it. It's not very hard that when we come in here and we upload a file like this, I'm just gonna like, grab a PDF, let's say. [00:58:00] It's going to then send that over and add it to our vector store. So you can see it just added this to my documents on the Gemini file base right here.

It is recorded in here. It shows it if it's active or archived or deleted, you can come in here and actually delete it. And if I delete it, it will go and delete it for me. There's an entire activity log that it keeps. All of this is running and will, you will run this locally on your own computer, so it's completely secure.

Um, it, it, it's very easy to use and you don't have to worry about deploying this to, you know, a web host or something like that. All that we're gonna need is a Gemini API key, which will show how to do that and walk through on getting the stack set up, which Claude code will help you do. 

Sara: Yeah, and there's a bunch of people are asking about Cassidy.

Is it another agent? No, it's not another agent in our workflow. It's just a tool that we teach on a platform that we teach on. So don't confuse it. We just mentioned it. It's not part of, it's not a new agent that you need to know about. [00:59:00] Um, and I see a bunch of questions guys. I also wanna make sure that we get through the de like the actual putting everything together and we will stay on to answer your questions.

So don't worry, even though it doesn't look like I'm paying attention, I am, I just wanna make sure that we're progressing as well. 

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. Cassidy is just a, a, like, it's another platform. It's not quite like NAN but they have crossover and, and like, we're having to build a lot of this stuff because. Uh, because we're using N eight N, that means you have to build some of your own infrastructure and that's what's happening here.

Um, okay, so let's switch back over to the slide deck over here for just a second and we can kind of get back onto the presentation track. And let's switch gears here for a minute. So do you wanna pick up, yeah. 

Sara: So hopefully what, um, you are, you know, you've, you are witnessing is we're entering a world where instead of being in execution mode, so instead of being the person that goes, okay, I've gotta like, figure out [01:00:00] how I connect this node and drag and drop that node.

And is this like connection here, working to that connection and all the things, right? You are able to be an orchestrator. So you're, you are going from execution as a doer to more like the architect that designs what needs to be done. Okay? So that's like the world that we're, we're, uh, heading into because so far in ai, it's all been all about this new tool's dropped and this like learn this one, this tool today and that tool tomorrow.

And it's like very, very disorienting. And now the world that we're getting into with the ability to like just speak things into existence is like, how do you know what good looks like? And how do you design, how do you be, be the architect, the mind behind that and the AI does the execution. All right.

Yeah. Um, we can move on to the next slide. Okay. So do you wanna talk about how it all connects? Because we are like, all of that is amazing and. You, we need to get you there. Okay. So, and there's [01:01:00] a process, which is what we're gonna go into next, but do you wanna Yeah. Like really quickly go through that how Yeah, 

Tyler: exactly.

And like, so, so even I was like reading Miguel's, uh, comment in there was pretty funny dude. Um, it, like, I fully understand like seeing all of these systems and workflows and agents and, and the overhead of setting that up and keeping it up to date. That's why, um, like yes, if you had to do it in the old way, that would be really difficult to do.

Especially as like a one person shop. Now, not so much because you have a whole host of, we'll call 'em workshop agents that are going to help you actually set up and manage all of this stuff. So the process of what you're gonna see happen is that we are gonna describe our intent into, we're gonna be using cloud code in a tool called VS code.

Um, and we're gonna describe that and then cloud code is gonna help us build all of this out and then deploy it, set up all the infrastructure, deploy it, test it, qa it, even help us monitor [01:02:00] it, um, as we keep going so that once we get this in place, I mean it's very meta here. We're using AI to help build ai.

But that's really where we are right now and this state of things. Uh, and it works extremely well, which is amazing. And then what happens, like what we saw before is like, then we're building out that N eight N cloud engine, but there's some setup involved. And then the process, we will touch on this a little bit here.

The methods that we use both for like engineering mindset and improvement. This is stuff that we'll touch on now, but it just know that it's like baked into the infrastructure in the, the, the what y'all will be cloning down here in a minute. So that cloud code works from these methodologies on your behalf.

Sara: Yeah. So we baked it in essentially our whole methodology behind how we do this. So you guys don't have to work about that. And I hear a few people in the chat are feeling like overwhelmed. Like, um, like the reason why we're taking you through all [01:03:00] of this is because we want to you to be smarter through this process, right?

Like, we want you to understand what's going on, but you do not have to be doing all the things that is like the point of us, like talking you through this. So, um, just trust the process and like follow through the step by steps and everything that we're gonna give you. Um, and it is just like, it is a mental leap because it is a different way of working For sure.

Well, like I wanna acknowledge that. Um, but if you like, push yourself beyond that, if you trust the process, you'll be amazed at what you could do. Like you will be amazed at the possibilities. 

Tyler: Okay. Got it. Okay, so let's. 

Sara: We're gonna go into the set, the setup now. Um, and again, like I wanna also say that some of you have started the setup, some of you haven't.

That's totally okay. We're gonna go through it and we're gonna have a loom video we send afterwards because this is live, you know, um, that is more [01:04:00] of a step-by-step, so you can follow that. Um, so wherever you're coming from, it's okay. We're not gonna, like, we're, it's, this is gonna be a little bit faster, but we are gonna make sure that we give you more of a like, uh, you know, logical way of following this through after the class.

'cause there's a lot happening right now. 

Tyler: Yeah. You got it. And also, like someone asked about the toast method, we'll talk about that really quickly. This is like an adapted version of how it has it written out here on this screen for this set and setting. But basically it's a recursive improvement methodology, so, um, totally overwhelming and sucking tequila.

I love it. No, so it's like, it's take your output, um, observe and determine like what's working well, what's falling short. Uh, you're going to analyze the outcome and come up with ideas. Then you're gonna stick it back in the oven. So like, uh, like you're, you're gonna hypothesize like, what is an update or a change that I can make?

Put that back into the system and test it again. So it's like this recursive loop and the, the very short story behind that is like, [01:05:00] hopefully this will help land this and make sense in your brain. And it's a, a dad story for you or, yeah. Uh. There was some human that figured out that, hey, we could grow wheat and then we could cut this down and pound it with a, a mortar and pestle and then add water to it, throw it in the fire and make bread.

And like you would think that would be good enough and stop there. I think we can all agree that bread's amazing. And then some other person came along and was like, Hey, I think I could take this to the next level, or let me try this new technique. And they took that bread and they threw it back in the fire and then we got toast.

And it's this whole idea of continuous improvement and this feedback loop that you have in the process that we embody and that is baked into these systems, that it's also alluding to a technique called the meta prompting. So there's a, there's a word that y'all can start throwing around in your friend circles too, and you'll sound much more, uh, like tech bro, AI bro.

Uh, but it's like using these techniques help improve the system by [01:06:00] looking at your output, running evaluations on it, coming up with hypotheses of what it is that you could go in and make improvements on. Go test those again, like we're very scientific about that, of like running isolated tests on it and then running the test again.

So that's, that's kind of the, the lapse there. Okay. 

Sara: Okay. So this is the hardest part is today. Yeah, like, we wanna be honest about that because, uh, there are new kind of things that you need to get set up and your brain is gonna be stretched and you're gonna be wondering like if you're doing the right thing, if you're looking at the right thing, but like, trust the process.

Because once you get over that hump like this, ev all sorts of possibilities will be open for you and you will become like you will be operating in a different way. And I wanna call that out 'cause someone said, you know, uh, you have a great style of teaching. Um, we always say to our students, we're here for both the mindset as well as the learning because this is a mindset change.

This is like, you are [01:07:00] changing habits, you're changing the way that your brain wa is wired essentially to work in this new way. But if we can get you there and Yeah, and then, and then you let us know, you know, whether, whether it was worth it or not. So, okay. Tyler, I think it's time to go in the, um, 

Tyler: yeah, so okay, let's talk about this and then I'll go back into actually like, we're gonna go build this and do the walkthrough of how do you all actually all do this.

So there are the tools of what we're building to in production, which is what we showed y'all here a little bit earlier, of all the different agents in those N eight end workflows. And these are the tools that are gonna help us make all that happen. So some prerequisites of what you're gonna want to have and try and follow along and either do today or do after class, like.

Um, like even if you want to do this, like work on it to Friday and come back with questions, we're gonna help you through all this VS. Code is what's called a, uh, a coding IDE. It's basically just an app. It's 100% free, it's from Microsoft. [01:08:00] Um, and it's in like, fun fact. This is what, if you've heard of the tool called Cursor or Windsurf or Anti-Gravity or some of like similar type tools.

All of them are, are forks or, or clones of VS. Code that those companies have built on top of and customized them because it's, it's open sourced now. Uh, so that's, that's the tool that we're gonna go set up and, and run here in a minute. Claude Code is going to be the coding agent that we use within VS code.

And it's a really simple setup here. In a minute I'll show you that they have an extension that makes this easy. I'm telling y'all, if you have not used Claude Code or Codex, which is open AI's version or something else like that, your mind is about to be blown here in a minute. Um, you're gonna need to have an innate in cloud account and all of this is gonna be in a PDF in the repo that you all can follow along in yet another [01:09:00] resource to do this, like step by step in case you get lost and, and you're more of like, I wanna follow written instructions kind of person.

We got you covered with that in there also. So you're gonna need the innate in cloud. They do offer a free version, uh, I think for like free trial for like 14 days or something like that. Or if you just, you know, pay for it for one month if you don't already have it. Um, it, I think it would be a, a, a good investment in this class, but even the trial would be enough to get us cross, um, to get this built.

We're gonna need to go and get some API keys set up as well. So we're gonna need to set up our Google Gemini key. You could think of this as like our password to be able to use Google's files, store and their models. And then we're gonna go ahead and pull down the, the repo or repository, what's called cloning it down into BS code.

So it basically what that's gonna do is take that from the cloud and download it onto your local computer [01:10:00] so that you can work on it there and it's like disconnected from the cloud version. Okay, now let's switch and I'm gonna stop this screen. Share and switch screens here. Y'all, uh, where is my, I've got too many windows open here.

There we go. All right, so let's go over here to this screen now, and I'm gonna close this out. So let me move this zoom over here and move this so I can see on this window. Alright, can everybody see, or sorry, can you tell me, can you see vs code now? Or can someone just like drop it in the chat? I wanna make sure that.

Zoom's keeping up with me here. Sweet. Yes. Alright, cool. So this is vs code. Um, like we can answer questions on this a little bit more. I want to kind of like get past that right now. And already over here, this is, I've clicked on this explorer and this is got our, our files in here. So the very first step is you're gonna want to navigate, you could either like Google or perplexity or we have it in [01:11:00] the PDF guide if you happen to have that pulled up.

Uh, and you can go and download VS code and install that on your machine. That's gonna be step one. Step two when you get in here is gonna be going right here to these little boxes on the left hand side and it's called extensions. This is what makes this very easy to install cloud code or Codex or whatever it is that you wanna run with everything that we're gonna be teaching to in class again 'cause we had to pick a tech stack.

Um, we're gonna be doing this all on cloud code. You can definitely do the same process using Codex and and chat GPT with chat GPT projects. We're gonna be using Claude Code and Claude Projects on the desktop to work together. Um, and in here to go find that, all you have to do is come into the extensions 'cause it won't be installed yet for you.

And search cloud code, that's like a little marketplace in here of apps that can be installed within VS. Code. And you'll see that it has a blue [01:12:00] check mark by it and it says Enro. That's the company that makes it. You want to make sure that you are getting the exact right extension when you hit install.

It'll have the blue install button like next to it. I've already done it, so it's, it doesn't have that here for me, but you're gonna click install and it will walk you through that process. When, and I'm gonna do this from scratch, like SAR and I'll have this in the Async video so you see it completely from zero.

What this looks like, what happens next is once cloud code goes through the install process, it's gonna ask you to basically log into your Claude account. Um, all, all you need to have is at least like a $20 a month account. Even if you just buy it for this one month to learn this, that will give you access to Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

Um, like we are, uh, platform and tool agnostic, that's what we teach. But everybody's got a favorite kid and Claude code is mine. Like I, I love it. This is like one of my favorite tools and it proves always to be like one of the [01:13:00] best, if not the best. That's like a Chevy versus Ford type argument though. So we would've had VS code installed.

Then we come in here and install the cla code extension. Now's where the magic starts happening. Like now we're able to see. Once you do that and you walk through that process, you'll see this little icon start to show up right here within VS code. So this little orange icon is the CLO code icon, and if you click on that, it opens up this little chat menu.

So this looks like way less, um, uh, intimidating, right? Like this just looks like chat, GBT or, or clog in here. And then you also, if you installed Codex, that's what this is too. You see this little icon, you can click on it and Codex, which is opening eyes version, pops up over here if you want to install that and play around with that as well.

If you have a chat GBT account, then you're able to, um, like come in and use that, uh, like on top of it, like that subscription [01:14:00] covers it. Basically, once you're in Claude Coat and you're in a completely fresh account, let me show you what you can do. So if I come in here, let's go new window and I'm gonna open up quad code and I'm just, so this is what it might look like.

You don't have any files loaded yet, like so there's no folders added in. You just have Quad code installed. And we're just gonna come and talk to Claude and have it help us. Uh, and, and this is all in the PDF, right? We're gonna need to have the GitHub, CLI, Claude, if you don't already have that installed.

And I need you to look up research and find any and all the tools and even use this PDF that I'm providing you, uh, so that I can now clone down my, uh, GitHub repo that I'm including in this link below. And I'm gonna paste that in. Now I want you to clone that down so I have a local version of that on my computer to start working in.

Please. Alright, so I literally talked to [01:15:00] AI agents, so if y'all see me doing this, uh, I'm using a, I know we'll get asked. Um, I use a tool on my local computer called Mac Whisper. It is a Mac only program. I'm sorry, y'all, there are other options out there that work on PC as well, like aqua voice or, or things like that.

Um, it'll, it transcribes what I say as fast as you saw it. It uses a completely free LLM running on my own Mac studio here at home to do that work. And I, I just had to buy the app once and now I have free transcription forever that just runs on my machine. And that's how I interact with these systems.

Now, anyone who knows me or has been in class or has hung around me for two seconds knows that my job description now should be something like I talk with a funny accent to robots. Like that's literally what I do. I audibly talk to them. So I wanna normalize this because you could talk way faster and just, you don't have to necessarily type it out.

Then the other thing that you're gonna need here is, let me go grab, uh, the repo [01:16:00] URL. So this is the repo URL. I'll drop this into the chat just so everyone has it. It's also gonna be in the PDF onboarding guide, all the things. And if I come back over here to my VS code where I just told it what I wanted to do, I'm just pasting in this GitHub repo as well.

And basically what I'm telling you, I already have this stuff installed and Claude's probably gonna recognize this and, and come back and tell me this. For Claude to go and take actions on my behalf, it needs to have this GitHub tool is what it is. And the GitHub tool allows it to go and look online at GitHub or into my own account on GitHub, which is basically like a, um, it's where our repositories are synced.

To think of it as kind of like a Google Drive location for coding is the best way to maybe explain it. Um, it, the, the Google or the GitHub CLI tool helps it go and actually go get that stuff. [01:17:00] So if, if you don't have that, it would go and pull that down for you and install it and walk you through that, which we have documented.

And then now it's going to go and clone is what it's called. But basically pull down this, this repository that we have built out and shared with y'all. And you'll see this in cloud code. Same thing in Codex, because we don't want the agents to just go out and start taking action on our behalf without like our oversight.

Right. It will come back and ask you these things like, do you want it to go and run a bash command? A bash command to try and detect, bro, that is, think of it as it's gonna go run a snippet of code to go execute on a task for you. You can either tell it yes and it will just like you're approving this one time, you can hit uh, yes and don't ask again.

So it will quit asking you for this particular kind of bash command for this thread. Or you can tell it no if you don't want it to do it. Or you can just come down here and type in and tell it something completely different instead. I'm just gonna go ahead and hit yes and don't [01:18:00] ask again. So it just, it comes and pulls all this down.

Sara: And for those people in the chat that feel lost, it's totally fine. We're mm-hmm. Like you're, we're gonna actually send a loom and step by step instructions after this. 'cause I know some people have to drop as well, so don't worry. Just try to follow along. We will make sure that we have you guys covered.

Okay? Uh, we have to go fast because it's live, but there will be step by steps. 

Tyler: Yep. And, and if you look at this, like Claude went and, and copied it, downloaded this repository for us. So all of these files and all that looks like if we come over here and, sorry, let me minimize this to the screen right here is, if we come over here and look at at at it, all it is is like a folder that has a bunch of files in it that's literally all this thing did is went and downloaded a bunch of files onto our local machine for us.

And it's coming back and even it recognizes, Hey, I see a bunch of documentation in here including onboarding and a readme and a setup and all this kind of stuff. Do you want me to go [01:19:00] ahead and get this loaded and start the onboarding process? We're gonna tell it yes. And this is part of like, if you can get to this stage, if you can get to this stage where you have VS code installed and clawed code installed, we have this thing built so that it kind of takes the wheel for you and you don't have to know or be overwhelmed with, holy crap, what is all this like code looking stuff happening in the background.

Like it, it's setting it all up for you, um, on your behalf without you having to necessarily know how to do that manually. So I'm gonna go back and tell it again. Uh, yes. Claude, I would like you to go ahead and run and explore this repo thoroughly please, and then run any onboarding or set up processes that need to be done.

Please. Thank you. All right, so again, I'm talking to my little genie in a bottle right here that can go do all this stuff for me, which is amazing. And if you've never seen this, [01:20:00] the, the clog code agent is the one of the most agentic experiences that you're gonna be able to get on the market today. And it's also very good at things beyond just coding, which like, that's something we could get into maybe in a Friday session.

But it's amazing at what this thing is able to do in here and start doing multiple different things at scale on your behalf. So right here, 'cause it's gonna do stuff fast for us, right? Right here, just ask me, Hey, is it okay to run that command? To go and explore the repo means that it sends out a bunch of little subagents to go and look through all of the information that it just downloaded.

So it understands it, it pulls it into its context window and then it can start executing on that. So I approve that and then what happened is it went and read the read me files, the onboarding file, the setup files that have instructions for your cloud code to go and set up all this stuff on your behalf, which is what it's doing.

So like, because I've already done this, it [01:21:00] recognizes that I have a, uh, a duplicate in here. And so I'm gonna tell it's asking to re remove the duplicate directed directory. Yours wouldn't say that 'cause you wouldn't have downloaded it yet, but I'm just gonna go ahead. This is how smart it is. It's recognized that, and I'm having it go and replace my existing one right now.

For yours, it would just say like. Hey, um, I, I've got this ready. Where do you want me to move this on your computer so it stores it in the correct spot. It even knows how to set that up. And we'll go move all these files around for you and now it's done. And if you really want to, to look at how this thing is working, like some of the most interesting stuff is it's, it sets itself up these little to-do lists and then it has these thinking traces right here.

So if you expand those out, you can see even its internal thought processes that it's doing along the way. And then it's reported back. And tell me what we got. So set up complete, like, here's the repository location. So it put it into a folder for me on my local computer. It moved it from [01:22:00] my desktop into a GitHub folder.

It labeled it the Mindvalley AI Mastery Student Folder for the repo. It's updated it to the latest one. It's telling me the structure and what all's in here and what we're building per the course. It's tell 'cause it knows what it is that we're working towards. It knows that we're building a knowledge base, the expert agent, email processor, the whole thing.

And so it says the next steps that it needs to do from the onboarding process is to run a setup script that's passed and it's telling me what it's done and what it has left to do in here. And so we just need to read through this and talk to Claude and it'll help us like onboard the rest of our workshop tools that we all are gonna need here.

So, let's see here. Mine is telling me the setup script pass. Here's what's remaining. Configure Claude desktop. Uh, and the project from the docs, which we've done test the, the bridge round trip. Okay, so required accounts from the setup and would you like me to help with any of these next steps? [01:23:00] I'm gonna tell it yes and you can do the same thing.

Hey Claude, I am actually doing this as a demo in the class right now, uh, emulating exactly what the students are doing. And so I would like you to walk me through this step by step and help me make sure that I get fully onboarded, that we don't miss anything and that you help me get fully set up for class so I can start building and be prepped to do this work, please.

Thank you. So you can see I'm just talking to it plain language. It, it's very important to be just like clear and descriptive. Honestly, you can't be overly verbose. Like the more information you give it, the more like context that you give it, the better it's going to do. And so it recognizes that we need to, we have GitHub done.

It needs to know if I have a innate in account, it needs to know if I have my Google account set up. Um, it needs to see if I have a Gmail account set up Slack, 

all done 

CLA or chat GBT open Router vs. Code and [01:24:00] cloud code. And it's already put check marks by some of these things for me. And then right here, it's like even set up its own internal to-do list that it's gonna keep walking through as it gets me through this process, which is.

Kind of amazing. All right, so step one and two are done. Step three is gonna be configure claw desktop. Let's talk about this for a minute. As a part of using agents to build agents here, like with these tools, without like going too far into the weeds, there's, by using the Claude Code agent in VS code, we can do so much like it has the ability to control your computer, move files around, like what, what it just did.

It can go out on the internet and research, it can spin up multiple different subagent to do things on our behalf. It's an extremely powerful tool. What it does not have is it does not like out of the box have a, a vector store connected to it. So the other thing that we're gonna do is set up Claude [01:25:00] Desktop and they don't natively talk to each other.

So if I set up a project in Claude desktop, and I do work over there, and it's maybe even connected and set up to this, um, our, our repository that we have for this project. If I talk to Claude Desktop and I talk to Claude Code, those are like two siloed conversations. They never, they never, uh, two strangers passing in the night kind of thing.

Whereas we have built a, what we call a bridge system that allows you to talk to Claude Desktop and to Claude Code to be able to use both of those tools for different benefits. And you can even ask Claude code to explain to you, um, like how, and why it works and why we would do this and all these sorts of things.

But the, the, the short answer here is that if we come over here, let me get Claude desktop open back up and we're in Claude desktop and we go to a, uh, our project over here once we have this installed, and you would go, [01:26:00] new project, like Claude's gonna walk me through all this. I'm gonna hit new project and let me move some windows around.

There we go. Um, and we're gonna call this project AI Mastery. What, and you could call it whatever you want, right? So I'm gonna go AI mastery, I'm gonna put this in here. I'm gonna create project. So what happens now, this is like, this tool is so amazing in itself. Now that we have a project and we have memory en enabled, every conversation we have within this project is accessible to Claude.

It can go and like look at a memory and all the past conversations if it ever needs to, because when you, if you've ever used a tool like this or chat GBT, you know that you might eventually hit the end of the thread where you hit the context window and you have to start a new conversation. And that's really frustrating if you like didn't get done.

And it's like, oh shit, I need to, I need to tell this new agent what I was doing. Well, now the, this way that this cloud desktop [01:27:00] agent works, it can go and look at past conversations to figure that out. So that's one benefit. The other benefit is this right here, the file section, this is like a miniature vector store, a miniature knowledge base that is a vector store.

And the reason this is different than the way that Claude code works, when Claude code goes and pulls some of these files or looks through the information, it will go and actually like, pull the whole file down and look at it. If we did that over here in Claude desktop, it does what's called a semantic search, which the way that those two things operate are, are completely differently.

And there's benefits to both, but that's why we're, we're using the file store here as well. So Claude is gonna walk us through getting this set up the rest of the way. Um, let me see. It was this window right here. So it, it told me to name it. AI mastery add custom instructions. Here's the content to paste.

It's [01:28:00] saying, uh, copy everything below the custom instructions, and it's telling me where the file is on my local computer. Here's something else you can do. Like if you, if it ever tells you like, Hey, like go get the instructions to paste in the Claude desktop or do this, like, you can go find it in this location.

If you don't want to go hunting for it, you don't have to anymore. Just tell Claude code. Hey, uh, I'm feeling extra lazy today. Can you just go get those custom instructions for me and then bring them back to me and tell me what I need to do with them, please. Thank you. 

Sara: Um, Tyler, while this is happening, I just wanna make sure that we don't miss on a couple of questions.

I think if I'm reading correctly, it's to ask with like the um, Claude code, like I think it's to do with the subscription. I lost it already. I was like, I don't wanna lose that one. I think it was to do with like the cost of it with Claude. If you have Claude and cloud code requires a minimum pro account on Claude.

Can you confirm it didn't work with a free version until I upgraded to the paid version? And [01:29:00] then I had another Quest question that was, um, sorry. I'll find it while you answer that. 

Tyler: Yeah, so I, I, I do believe that philanthropic requires a, a, a minimum of a $20 account to be able to use all these right now if you have never used CLO before and especially never used CLO code, it's the best $20 you can spend in AI right now, in my opinion.

Like, it, it is, like it. So basically, 

Sara: sorry, the question, the other question was like, is that the cloud code gonna take the credits from my cloud account essentially? 'cause it runs out pretty quickly, is what they're saying. 

Tyler: Yeah. Uh, no, they're, they're different. So like the, the bucket of of conversations that you have with Claude code is different from the bucket of conversations that you have.

In Claude desktop and like you could start at the $20 a month plan, um, then they can scale up from there. Like it is basically like how much you're gonna use the tool Beyond that, I personally have a $200 a month plan on Claude is what I [01:30:00] pay for. And I would pay that like five times over every single month because of what it enables me to do.

And like, even beyond what we're gonna talk about in the scope of this course, and maybe that's something we can get into on a Friday session or in q and a or something. But you, you can, you can do the course with the $20 plan, but like even if you find yourself scaling and it's like, Jesus, is it really worth spending $200 a month for this?

If you figure out how to use it? Like what I'm, what what we're teaching you a hundred percent. And, and then some. Um, okay, so, okay, so now it it like, I was lazy. I asked Claude to go get me the instructions and bring 'em back to me. 'cause I didn't want to go find 'em on my computer. It went and pulled that file and now it gave it back to me and it's telling me exactly where to, what to do with it.

Like to the t. So it's saying go to Claude desktop in the app, not the browser. That's an important distinction. You need to have the Claude Desktop app downloaded. You're gonna go to the folder icon and create the AI [01:31:00] mastery. We already did that. And then we're gonna click the add custom instructions and paste this in.

Cool. So if I go here, it is right here. Here's my AI mastery project on the Claude Desktop app. I am gonna go into right here, the instruction section is what it's talking about, hit plus. And now I'm gonna just paste in the instructions that Claude code gave back to me. I'm gonna hit save instructions.

This is like a system prompt or system instructions for this project now. So if, if y'all are familiar with that, what that is, which I, I'm sure that you do if you're in this class. Um, that's what we've just pasted it in here. Okay. So now Claude better understands how to make this work. The other thing that you can do in here, and Claude will, will tell me this, but I'm gonna go ahead and jump the gun on.

Some of it is there's gonna be some files you can add in here and there's also, you can hit plus on this and connect your GitHub account. So if I wanted to come in here and go GitHub and go [01:32:00] look for this repo for me and pull this down in here, I could come in here and click this and now it will sync that repository into the file store over here in Claude desktop so it can see it as well.

Uh, so it has like context of what are we doing over here in Claude code? Like there's, they're syncing back and forth in that way from GitHub. Also 

Sara: kind of like sharing your Google, Google Drive with Claude kind of thing. It's the same kind of idea. 

Tyler: You got it? Yeah. 

Sara: So like, we are at one 30 now, which is our time, and we're like in the setup version.

We are gonna go over, like I said, into now the projects once we're, we've done with the setup and I know that you guys have to drop. There will be the recording, we will be sending the step-by-step and everything. Um, this is the hardest part, right? Like once you get your yourself set up and all of that, the other things that are gonna come from that is gonna be, you're gonna be like, okay.

Like it's, it's not gonna be as like mentally, you know, uh, you've [01:33:00] got a thousand tabs on your, in your mind kind of thing. 

Tyler: Yeah. So I'm gonna, I'm just gonna try and get this, uh, to the next few parts in here. Mm-hmm. And it might all done be as quickly as we can. And if you hear someone talking in the background, that's literally Claude code talking to me.

It just said all done. Um, because like, once you learn how to do this, I have multiple tabs of CLO clot. It's called Clotting of Claude Code Open, doing multiple different things at the same time. And if I don't have, uh, like this custom thing that like surprise surprise, Claude Code built for me and installed, it has a voice capability now.

So it will ping me audibly when it finishes something. So if you ever hear something in the background, and it sounds like my computer's talking, it's because it is. Um, okay. So it went ahead and checked off. It was making sure that Claude code is working. It's like, well you're doing this now. So good. Uh, we can, we're, we're good to check that off the list.

Now it's trying to build the bridge and test that up. So this test, uh, the [01:34:00] workflow you'll use, uh, in the course of Give ai task, AI executes it, you review the results and let me read the sample task and execute on it for you. So what, how, how we can use this bridge is if we're over here in the Claude Desktop app and we're talking and, and brainstorming with it and trying to think about what are some tasks that we need to have done that we want to send into Claude Code to have it start executing on.

So think of this as kind of like, uh, kind of like one of our project management kind of hubs right here. And then we want Claude Code to be the executor of the task that we set up. This bridge system helps do that. So it will write out all the spec documentation, sync it to GitHub, and then now Claude Code can see it.

And this is building that two-way bridge so that Claude Code can talk to desktop and vice versa in here. This is really like cool stuff. [01:35:00] Alright, so it's telling me that it's red, what it needs to do. It's gonna create th three simple FAQs for the knowledge base. Quick question for the demo. What business should I use for the examples?

I'm just gonna do Hattie Bees. Okay. All right. Um, thank you Claude. I want you to just to go ahead and let's get this bridge set up quickly just to test it and verify that it works. And you can just do this for one simple. Task just to verify it works. And we can just use Hattie Bee's Hot Chicken for now, please.

Thank you. Please walk me through this process. 'cause I'm, I'm a bit in like outta my depth right now and I'm not, I'm trusting you and trusting the process like Tyler and Sarra said. So like literally you can talk to it and if you want it to explain things to you in a certain way or take on a persona or like break it down in bullet points, like whatever you prefer, just literally tell it that and it will, it'll adjust for you.

Um, so it's even giving us the mindset coaching here. Look, you're doing great. Trust the [01:36:00] process. Uh, the bridge test is what, what we're trying to prove. The concept is we give AI a task, AI does the work, we review its output and it helps build everything that we need to in this course and beyond. So now what it's gone and done is it's spun up and written it some different files right here.

It's committing them into GitHub and then it is coming back and telling me that it has put this in there. 

Ileana: All done. 

Tyler: There we go. And it's already trying to like be proactive and move on to N eight N. Can you give me just a message to give back to Claude desktop to verify that I have this all working properly, please.

I'm not sure if I do yet. Okay. And. We're gonna cover this more in depth in the loom video of like completely end to end. How do you do this and, and some things that you might run into along the way because it's, as y'all can see, there's a lot of stuff to cover in a, in a such a [01:37:00] short session. So right here, uh, it's got the message for me.

Oh, I pasted that into the wrong place. Whoops. Alright, so copy that. That was my bad. This is where I meant to send it through. Lemme come back over here and edit promise. I can walk, chew gum at the same top. Let's see.

So while this is writing its next message for me here, it's trying to verify that you have an innate n set up. And it's even gonna walk you through setting up an innate NMCP tool, which is, is secure. And we can talk about that more. That's going to allow both Claude code all done and Claude desktop to go and take action for you within N eight N so that it can go and edit, update, remove, delete, like all sorts of different things on your behalf.

So that removes the friction of learning the N eight N platform because now Claude, the the Claudes are our copilot at this in here. Um, okay, so let's paste this in. It wrote my little message here. I'm gonna come [01:38:00] over here, paste this back into the cloud desktop, hit save so it resends it through. And let's see if this works.

I don't know that it's got it, we have it set up all the way yet, so it might tell me that it's failing. And give me a message to go back to Claude Code to help finish setting it up. Or it might even, I mean, it's already set it up for me, so like, it, it just depends. But let the Claudes help you, like work through this to get it all set up.

Right. So, got it. Here's your project summary. Let's walk me through it. Um, it looks like we're good to go. So 

Sara: Tyler, um, there's a couple questions here about what is the relationship between Claude, the copy paste between both Claudes essentially, like what's the relationship, why are we doing that? 

Tyler: Yeah, so like, I just did that right now to basically get this set up and, and tested and verify that it works.

And I, I'm playing monkey in the middle right now to paste back and forth once it's completely set up and cloud code has installed on your computer. All of like [01:39:00] the scripts that need to be happening in the background and any the, the tool that it needs to install if it needs to have like N eight N or or any of that stuff set up.

Um, because it is like, when we did this for Sarah the other day as a dry run on one of her computers, she did not have, uh, like one of the Xcode tools installed in her, on her computer yet. And Claude recognized that and it asked her if it wanted to do it, explained why it needed to do it, and then went and did it on her behalf.

'cause that was a blocker for her to get this whole, um, bridge system set up. So that's why I'm saying like. Um, like right now when we're helping facilitate the onboarding, we have to kind of go back and forth between Claude Desktop and Claude Code until it's confirmed that it has everything connected and working in the bridge system.

And then once you have that, they, they will actually switch and they will write to the bridge system in GitHub and talk back and forth to each other in that way. [01:40:00] And they might or might not give you a prompt to tell the other agent to, Hey, go look, I just sent you a, a message in the bridge. Go look at it and do your thing.

Or, or vice versa. Hey, I just finished doing something in Claude code, tell Claude desktop so it's aware of it and gives me next steps or something. 

Sara: Yeah. And, and like also, like if you, while you're setting up and you have these questions, uh, Eliana's gonna send the Google Drive link for everyone, so we can answer those for you on Friday as well.

Tyler: Yeah. 

Sara: Um, I 

Tyler: mean, it, it's entirely possible to do like what we're saying without using this whole bridge system. I've just found that like in my own processes that this, it, it, it really adds a lot of value to have this like back and forth, um, between the two systems in here also. Yeah. 

Sara: And for everyone.

Yeah. Right now you're setting up the infrastructure for everyone who's like, what, what are we doing again? Yes. This is the infrastructure. 

Tyler: Yeah. We're setting up the, the, the AI that will build the AI for us, like in the rest of the homework stuff. [01:41:00] Uh, so, uh, like I, I'm going to like, for the sake of Tom, 'cause I know we're running over.

If you keep working, once you get clogged code up and running within VS code, it's gonna keep working down this checklist like what it's doing right here. So it's got the bridge working, it's then gonna make sure I have N eight n. It's gonna ask me some questions about my N eight N account so it can get that logged and set up in here.

It's gonna ask me if I've got my Google Gemini API key yet. 'cause we're gonna need that to set up the, the knowledge store and the stacks like for that, that knowledge base setup. It's gonna ask me if I've set up Open Router yet. Open Router basically allows me to go and get an API key to use for all of the different LLM models without getting rate limited.

That's an issue if, if that we found with our students in our other course that if we were to have you go straight to Anthropic or open AI and get API keys from there while you're in class, if you've never done that before, they have like tiers of [01:42:00] API and you can get rate limited. So by using open Router that that unblocks us from that, like you're not gonna get run into to limits on that.

Um. Claude will walk you through this entire process. I'm going to like, it's gonna get this all set up once it is all done, and let's say that you've got it done. Or even if you just get to a stopping point, this is a habit that you want to get into, is what I'm gonna do next. And it's called committing.

Uh, committing is tech bro speak in, in GitHub or, or, or in vs. Code for uploading the current version of the information that's in my local computer to sync it to the cloud. Because right now it's done all this work just on my local drive and it's not like in the cloud to save it there as a backup or make it accessible from another machine.

And so if you commit frequently, like, so if you tell Claude to, Hey, go upload this and document it and it will document it [01:43:00] and all this kind of stuff for us. And if you do that frequently, you, it's like you're creating little save checkpoints. So if you ever do something like wrong or, or, um, uh, one of the models does something incorrectly or something, it's able to roll back to a previous checkpoint and, and un um, like fix the mess up if it ever were to occur.

So it's kind of like time machine on, on Apple computers, if you wanna think of it in that way. That's kind of what it's creating there. Um, so like the way you would do this is Claude knows how to do this and we've already taught it and it's in the repo of how we want it to be done. Hey, Claude. Hey, I'm gonna pause right now because we're gonna switch gears and teach something else in class.

I'm gonna come back and finish this setup later. Can you commit this to GitHub? I don't have this. I've never done that before, so I think this is gonna be a new repo. Um, and I want to make sure this is done in a private way. So can you set this up all for me in a [01:44:00] private repo on GitHub, please. Thank you.

Okay. So now Claude would come back and it's going to what's called Commit these changes. It's gonna create that repo on our behalf, which is basically like setting up a new, uh, project on GitHub and then sync all this back to it. And it makes it private. 'cause there's private and public repos like this.

The student repo that we share with y'all is public. So like anyone can go to that repo, see it, pull it down and, and work within it. And it's called forking it, like making their own version of it. When I do a private repo, that means just myself and anybody I invite to it. That's the only people that can see it.

So it's thought about what it needs to do and then it's coming back and it's telling me, Hey, I, I need to go and push this to the main, um, in GitHub for you and settle this up. And that's what it's gonna go do now. Like it pushed it to a private repo. It's telling me that [01:45:00] it worked. Cool. It's gonna go up to, uh, update.

Its to-do list. And now I could go walk away and come back to it later and pick right back up where I started. I could even go in here, open a new fresh clawed code thread and say, Hey, go explore my repo to be up to speed and help me pick up where I left off last time. Like, you literally just talked to it like a person.

And it will help you. Keep moving the ball forward in here. All right? 

Yeah. 

Okay, let's, I'm gonna pause and take a breath, Sarah. So like, yes, we can go back into, um, homework beyond that. Okay. Because that's homework part one. 

Sara: Yeah. So guys, this was like homework part one. Um, that was a setup and honestly, like get through that part.

Um, and like, like we said, we're gonna send the loom, we're gonna like make it really clear. There were lots of questions as well. So we wanna make sure also that look when we are gonna, um, send the video that we're sort of covering that as well. So just give us like a little bit of time to make sure we're hitting all the nails in [01:46:00] the right places or whatever they say.

Um, but I wanna look, we're gonna take a clean break from that because that was the setup, right? Remember when we first started, uh, the conversation today, we said that we're gonna set up the agent today, the foundational agent that we're gonna need before we build the entire department next week. So, so this is where we're going to be going into like a clean break.

Maybe like take a deep breath, like do a clear, like, okay. Like compartmentalize that setup and now we're gonna like context switch into creating the first agent. Alright, so what we're gonna be talking about is, you know how we've talked about retrieval augmented generation in the past, right? We said when we set up our customer service department, we, yes, we want, like all of the information in the internet that makes our AI agents really smart.

But we wanna contextualize the, the agents to our business to like the, our SOPs, our standard [01:47:00] operating procedures, our policies, our frequently asked questions, all of those kind of things. So this is like this part that we're gonna go into now. Alright. Um, Tyler, you're driving. 

Tyler: Yep. Sorry. There we go. 

Sara: All right.

So why, why retrieval? Augmented generation? Why rag? We just call it rag. Okay. So, because AI, it answers questions from general training data. It doesn't have information about how to be specific policies or their internal docs or their brand voice, like, you know, whatever it's made up with. Okay. So it can set, we will send out generic, sometimes wrong and definitely not in your brand voice in terms of an output or in terms of a response.

So when we build and knowledge, knowledge base, which is rag, what we're doing is we're feeding the agents. The information that contextualizes it to our business, to our documents, to our FAQs. We're gonna train it on our brand voice and how we want it to sound, [01:48:00] because we want it to function as if like we train this whole big, you know, people, team, a whole big department on exactly all of these things.

Again, we're gonna anthropomorphize ai. When you hire someone to work for you, you don't just go see you later. You give them the FAQs, the policies, you say, Hey, this is how we, we sound like in our customer service department, this is the tone, this is the style. This is like, you know, how we escalate when things get crazy or whatever.

So that's what we're gonna be doing with our knowledge base. We're gonna be context giving the agents the contextual information they know to do the job, the best that they can do to be optimal in terms of how they respond. So, Tyler, can you go next? 

Tyler: Yep, there we go. 

Sara: Okay. So this is the concept of the brain versus the library.

When you have an AI assistant or an AI agent, right? You, you essentially give it access to all of this general purpose information that has been trained on, right? [01:49:00] So when you build an agent, remember the difference between an assistant and an agent is the fact that instead of you like getting a customer service email, feeding it into chat, GBT, prompting it and saying, Hey, that doesn't sound like what we do.

And then prompting it again and you're generating and you're going through this whole process. Alright? That is not the assistant acting with autonomy. What we do with agents is that we give them autonomy to reason, plan, do multi-step planning and take action or execute on your behalf. So we are giving an assistant degrees of agency or autonomy, right?

So we're essentially putting the, um, with the knowledge base, we are essentially having the agent with all of the context that it's been trained on and through the librarian, which is a connector tool, we're gonna give it access to the knowledge base. So that is going to be the contextual information that the agent needs to be able to respond in a way [01:50:00] that it has all of the power of a large language model trained on and contextualized to your business and the way that you will handle things and the way that you sound, the brand voice, your like voice within it.

So that's the difference between the brain and the library. Library. Alright. Um, so we talked about the concepts of the brain and the library, right? And now we're gonna, like what books do we add to the library, right? So we wanna be intentional. And again, for those people who asked write at the beginning, why, why don't I just have like one agent that does everything?

This is one reason why you wanna have multiple agents, right? That have different levels of specialization. That way you can get, like, we like to say, we like to build our agents. As, um, as if they're like PhD level, savant, bilities in their very narrow domains, right? So that way we can get the best out of the best out of our agents.

And these agents then have [01:51:00] very specific jobs that they perform with a lot of depth, and their, they're attached, their brain is attached to the right information, right? So the QA agent or whatever would have different information than like the policy or the brand voice agent, or the one that does the copywriting, because you might want your copywriting to reflect certain copywriting rules or whatever.

So different information to different agents. Um, but right now, congratulations because you've just been hired by Hattie Bees. So, uh, but you know, we live in 2025. We're going on to 2026. Thank you Hattie Bee for hiring me. But instead of hiring me to be your customer service representative, I'm gonna create an AI version of myself.

So what we're doing here is that we're creating, uh, a customer service agent that works for Hadi B, but as if you were the customer service agent. But you're not gonna obviously be sending the emails, right? You're gonna train an AI [01:52:00] agent to like reflect your brand voice, right? So in order for us to do that.

To have an AI version of yourself, you need three things, which is the knowledge. So you wanna have like, what is their menu, their food menu, right? If someone calls in and, and inquires about that, or your policies. So like if someone wants to return some food or whatever, or they're angry, like what are your policies, your FAQs, all of that kind of stuff.

So you wanna give the agent, um, the agent version of you the information so you, it knows what to say. You wanna give it, you're sending operating procedures, like how do we handle refunds, complaints, edge cases so that it does it the right way according to the policy. So again, like if you were hired by Heidi Bees, they would've taken you through training, right?

And given you a policy or a employee, me employee handbook. Think of it that way. That's what we're giving our agent. And then also your voice. So even though in the employee handbook that had bees gave you, [01:53:00] right? It says like, Hey, this is our style. We're not super corporate here. We like to like say, hey, sugar and like, you know, butter people up or whatever.

And we're very casual and southern in our, in our style, right? So that is the Hattie B's brand voice that they want you to meet. They want you to emulate that kind of tone and style. So we need to capture that, but we need to capture your voice within that. So you have a very different way, like I have a very different brand voice than Tyler does, or Elia or whoever, right?

We have very distinctive styles. So that's what you're building. You're building an AI version of you that is trained on, had bee's information. So if we go to the next slide. 

Tyler: Yep. Um, just like two quick caveats before we do that too, is that, um, again, Claude code knows all this stuff. So as you're thinking about doing this for the, the project for homework, it can guide you through what you need to do, what you need to add into the repo or what you need to add into the, the Gemini file [01:54:00] store and all that sort of stuff.

And also if you're wanting to brainstorm to build it for your own business or use case too, like outside of class you can use it to help it. How do you think through what kind of information do you need to have in the knowledge base as well? Like if it's not a restaurant and you don't need menus and things of that nature.

Sara: Yeah. So we need to add, add a couple of things. The books that we need to add to the library is the knowledge. So your AI knows what you know, or you know, what you've, the employee handbook essentially and the voice, the brand voice analysis we talked about way earlier on, like an hour and 30 minutes ago, um, around how, how you speak so that it's reflected when the agent responds to the customer service workflow.

It's, you know, giving the right information, contextualize the business in your brand voice. Alright, um, so. Echo, we introduced you to you earlier. So [01:55:00] Echo is the brand voice tool that we use to go deeper, right? Some, most people say, okay, we're professional, yet friendly when that's my brand voice. But what I say, I like to be communicated to, or I communicate in a personal, yet friendly and concise way.

It's completely different to what Tyler means when he says that AI hasn't been trained on what so means when she says that or what Tyler means when he says that. So our echo workflow is, is essentially intended to really reflect your very unique tone style, the cadence of which you say the type of words that you say like Tyler uses y'all a lot and like, you know, very like southern things.

Sarah might say. Really corporate jargon sometimes, which Tyler loves. Um, um, so it's intended to really capture that information. So in order for it to understand and to capture that information, you're going to give it [01:56:00] information for it to analyze. And that could look like three to five really good emails that you feel reflect your tone of voice.

It could be even a transcript of a zoom call that you have or whatever it is, right? So you're wanting to collect like samples of your own communication style. And then you're gonna feed into, um, into the Echo workflow, and it's going to output a brand voice file for you, right? So then that will be part of what you use to customize your agent, which is sugar, the expert agent that we are building today.

All right,

Tyler's multi. That's what I'm 

Tyler: trying to keep, keep up with the chat at the same time. You're good? Yeah. 

Sara: Yeah. So, um, so we're gonna teach AI to sound like, like you, like I said, this is a step by step process. You're gonna create what we call a mega doc. Um, essentially gather your best emails, transcripts, content, could be LinkedIn posts, whatever, you know, whatever you feel represents you.

Uh, a variety of [01:57:00] things that can work quite well because it captures your voice, kind of like from different dimensions. And then you're gonna put it into the echo workflow. And then that's gonna generate a brand voice analysis of, of you. We'll also generate what we said is an XML snippet, an x ml block.

It's a block that summarizes like, 'cause it's gonna produce a lot. The analysis is actually really thorough and I would recommend reading it. It's kind of fun. Um, but then it will, it will like summarize it into a block that you will then, you know, copy and paste and update your sugar agent, which we will provide you with.

And then that is what will personalize your agent. To sound like you, that will be part of the, uh, team members in the ENT workflow that we're gonna add the different team members on today. So Tyler, would you, okay, so yeah, like I said, then that enables us to personalize the sugar agent. So the brain is the knowledge we connected [01:58:00] to.

Maybe Tyler, you could talk about the stack thing in a bit. The voice, we paste your echo profile, so it sounds like you and the results that you get is an agent that knows not only what to say, like trained on that knowledge that we've given it, the contextual information, but also how to say it to sound like you.

And so we're gonna open the sugar, sugar agent system instructions, and we're gonna add in the brand voice, uh, like essential summary, the snippet that it provides us. And this is the moment that the robot becomes your employee, right? It becomes like train on your business. It becomes sound like you, it becomes your AI version essentially.

Tyler: Alright. And like the, the thing to remember at that point too. So like, all right, we're in homework time, so let's go. Um, I guess like before we come here, lemme stop my screen share and we'll go back over here into like, how do we do this stuff? Um, really the quick version here as quickly as I can make it.

Uh, so let's go share. [01:59:00] Um, okay. So just how Sorrow was describing on how we need to go and do all of this work. As you might imagine, uh, we can use cloud code to help us do a lot of this stuff too, to speed it up. So even as we're making our mega doc, as we are trying to pull in information and do this as we want to think through updating our sugar agent, once we actually have all of the, the analyses and all of these sorts of things done, uh, like get in the habit of like, can Claude go code do it like most likely, um, is what I would tell you.

So even what I did, I had transcripts from class and, and from like lessons that we had shot and I had, uh, like examples of writing and things like that saved on my local computer. So I literally came in here and told Claude code that exact thing. Hey, go and look on my computer and see if you can find some good examples of transcripts in my [02:00:00] communication.

Pull the whole, like transcript and copy it into my repository here in this project. So then it would take it and add it over here into the repo. So let me like open this up really quick. Um, so if I open this, it would take it and add it over here into this repo for me, and then start making the mega doc type process in here, um, and, and assembled it for me.

And then it could give it back to me as like a completed file that we're gonna take over into N eight N. But even before you can get to the N eight N piece. Um, you're, you're gonna have to have Claude Code go and like walk through the rest of the onboarding that we kind of like skipped ahead on because of time here.

And once it's set up N eight N and it can actually go and do things on behalf for you, it will go and ship these templates that we showed you over here in our N eight n into yours, because they're in that [02:01:00] repository in GitHub and Claude knows how to go set all this up for you. So once that's done, this is where you're gonna get into the Echo brand voice tool.

It's probably not gonna put it into nice and neat little folders like I did that later, uh, because I was just like OCD about it. But it'll put like all the workflows in here in your per personal section and you're looking for the, an, uh, echo brand voice analysis folder is what you're looking for. And or, I mean, um, and it in workflow rather, you're gonna click on this.

This is that, that big fun workflow we showed y'all earlier where it's doing all these, your communication style, linguistic analysis right in here and what you want to do. And, and Claude can walk you through this completely. You're gonna zoom in to this very first trigger right here. 'cause this is just a very simple, um, workflow.

And you're gonna click on this like once it has it set up, it, it might need to get some API keys from you to finish the setup as part of like the onboarding. But [02:02:00] once you're, you're past that, you're gonna come in here and go to the, to this first node and click on production URL. Again, if you're, if you're lost and you don't know what to do in here, Claude is your co-pilot on all of this.

It, it knows what the secret is. So you grab this URL right here, and you just open a new tab in your website browser, and now we're at something that looks like much easier, right? This is just an innate n form that is connected as an like an ingestion form into that workflow. And so you're gonna come in here and you're gonna choose, am I doing this for my own personal brand voice?

Am I doing it just for the organization at the organization level, or am I gonna do some sort of combined version herein? Like you have some options. I would recommend, like, we built it this way so y'all could use it beyond the class. We already have the Hattie B stuff done, so you don't need to do the company stuff that's already baked into it.

So you're gonna choose personal, you're gonna put in your name. [02:03:00] So I'm just gonna put in like Tyler Fisk here. I don't need to put company name in because like I've already, uh, already selected personal writing samples is where I'm gonna go take my mega doc and I'm gonna take the entire contents of my mega doc and paste that in here.

Um, and then company materials, we don't need that because we're not doing the company version. That's just for if you run it outside the class and then the, the. QC validation is like if you wanted to, to save a little bit of time and like hardly any money at all, you could bypass the quality control step in that workflow.

But I just would select no, which is what's recommended. Um, okay. Then what we would do if I come back over here, let me get into the repo that I actually have. My, my mega doc in. Bear with me here, y'all. Um, uh, let's see here. Session one, wrong one. Let's see, task right here. Brand voice. [02:04:00] Okay, so if we look, this is a vs.

Code repository. That's like an internal one for this class, right? And this is where we've done a lot of this development and it's also where we've like tested and, and built out all this stuff. So as you begin to build out your repo, you'll see in here it begins adding more like files. The bridge is gonna keep a history of what's been done and you're gonna fill it up with like more and more information over time, just like you might do in a Google drive.

And this is the mega doc that assembled for me that I was talking about a minute ago by going and grabbing my transcripts and just like putting it all together for me. So you no longer have to go and like grab the transcripts, like literally if you can give it the files or tell it where they're located.

Or even give it your LinkedIn URL. It can go and look at your LinkedIn and pull down social posts and things like that to go and ingest that information, add it to your repo and produce this file for you. That's the input for this workflow. So I'm gonna copy all of this mega doc that it's made for me.

I'm gonna come back over here [02:05:00] to my web browser where I had that innate end form up. And I'm just gonna paste this in and then I'm gonna scroll up because it might make some little annotations for you. Like right here it's telling me like end of mega doc and if you forget to delete it, it's probably not gonna be the end of the world, but I'm just gonna delete it out just in case.

So now it's just my transcripts in here and it's literally taking transcripts and examples of like my writing and stuff and chucked it into one massive document for me. And I'm gonna hit submit. And what this has done is now it's gonna kick off this workflow over here underneath the hood. So if I come back into my N eight N desktop right here, and I go into the executions section right here, you'll see that it's gonna start running.

So there's like the editor tab and the executions tab. And again, I know we're going through this fast. If in doubt, ask Claude code and it will help like guide you through the process. [02:06:00] And this takes just a minute to run. It should take, like, depending on how much you give it, maybe five minutes. If it runs more than five minutes, then you can come in here and click stop execution.

Uh, because that was happening to me earlier. It got caught in a loop, um, like without getting into like the weeds on it, but it, like, for some reason it kept looping in there and it, I just stopped it and it had already done all the work. It just wanted to keep like reviewing it again and like the parsing of it.

So if it finishes, it'll show green and it will show up like this. Uh, so like you can come in here and see all of the work that's been done. And in N eight n when you're looking in this, these green paths shows the path that the workflow took. 'cause there's some different logic of when it might take a different route in here, but I gave it my mega doc.

It ran through all these steps. It fed all of this over into my, uh, anthropic model. I'm running Haiku [02:07:00] 4.5 is the model that's doing all these different analyses right here. And these are different types of, uh, linguistic analysis of my communication style. And it creates, it uses sonnet 4.5 right here in this step to, to make that little code block that we need to add into our sugar agent to personalize that agent to us.

So if, if this runs to the end like it's supposed to, it should give you back the files in like a nice, neat formatted version. It should give it back to you all of the, the reports of the analyses all in like a nice succinct way and give you back a different file that gives you back the XML. And again, like, so you have both of those, you can just take back over into Claude code if for some reason you have to, to kill it and it it, like, it overruns or gets hung up.

'cause like these things happen, right? Like we're talking about tech. I would get used to like working in squishy situations, especially in this industry. Like you can, you can close this out [02:08:00] and you can also just come in and individually like, click on these nodes right here. That opens up like the re recording of what happened, right?

And over here it shows you this is what was the input into this particular step. Here's what all the parameters were around like this, like the LLM and, and the, the, the user prompt and system prompt, all that kind of stuff. And over here is the output, like what it produced out of this step. And an easy way to, to copy all this is if you come over here and click on JSON, it has that entire steps output and a nice, neat, easy way to do it.

So I could just come and copy this if I needed to and come back over here into my like clawed code and just like paste that in. And then come down and like repeat that process. Uh, so like I would come in and grab like the next output, make sure I'm on JSON, copy it and come in to, to clog code and [02:09:00] paste it back in.

And you would do that for, and I'm, you're only having to do this like manual copy and paste if it happens to fail, if not, like, because it could take it a minute to run. Uh, once it runs all the way, it should give you all these outputs, like nice and neat and formatted in files already for you. But just in case it doesn't, like I'm giving you the backup plan too, of like, you just go in, copy 'em out and paste it in and you're good.

And you also need this XML step right here. So this is creating the, the section that's gonna go into the system instructions for the sugar agent. So I'm gonna copy that as well. So let's pretend that I have, um, like all of these together. I have the files that it produced for me, and I go back over here to Claude Code and I, I paste all this in, or I attach the file either or, and to attach a file in here.

Um, you'll get used to this. There's this forward slash command right here. So if you [02:10:00] hit the forward slash command on your, your keyboard, it'll pull this up. Or you can literally just like click on this and it also pulls it up. And if you start typing and just start typing, attach. You can see this, and then it just pulls up where you could attach the file if you had it to download it in that way.

So that's a way that you can upload any sort of an attachment for cloud code to, to look at it, even be able to see it. So if you need to take a screenshot of somewhere that you're stuck, that's a really common way to help get yourself out of a situation is screenshot what you're saying and give it back to Claude.

It can see what you see and then help you move forward from there also. Uh, so again, like I'm, I'm trying to give you some of these like meta tips along the way also because this is a new mentality of how do I use this AI agent like this to help me build the things. It's a new mindset to have, to wrap your head around.

Hey, Claude. Um, so I have run the brand voice echo workflow, and I haven't copied all of [02:11:00] the analyses out yet, but I've grabbed a few of 'em and I grabbed the, the system instructions. I think the XML is, is what Tyler and Sarra called it, and I, I'm supposed to use that to personalize my sugar agent. And I'm supposed to also add these, um, uh, an analyses into my Gemini file store.

Can you help me with this process, please?

Okay. And so while this is running, uh, because it's gonna take it just a second, I wanna call something out right here too. I said it in the chat, but I wanna say it here also, is that if you hit shift tab while you're in VS code, like if I do that, you see how this is changing down here, where it switches between plan mode, ask before edits, and edit automatically.

These are different modes that you can put Claude into. You can also click on it and it will cycle through 'em too. Um, ask before [02:12:00] edits means that it's gonna come back to you more frequently and ask for your permission to go do things. If I go edit automatically, you're putting it more into YOLO mode where it will go do more things autonomously and check in with you less frequently.

It's not fully autonomous, but it gives, it takes the, the restraints off of it a little bit more. If you switch it into plan mode, plan mode puts the handcuffs on it and says, Hey, you can't go edit or update anything, but you can go look and research and formulate your game plan for how it is you're gonna go do this thing that, that Tyler just told me to go do, or you told it to go do.

And then it'll come back and say, Hey, here's my plan. Do you agree with this? If so, like yes and proceed forward with it. If not, tell it no or tell it how you want it to be different and it'll go back and come back with a new plan. And then you, you either approve it or not. But these are different modes that you can use within cloud code that are extremely powerful.

Um. So right here, Claude's telling me, Hey, I can help you with this. You've got great outputs from the Echo workflow. Let me break this down on [02:13:00] what I can do on both tasks, what you've collected. We have sentence structure analysis and vocabulary and tone analysis, plus my brand voice XML that are used for your sugar agent.

Let me create the files for each of these so we can save them properly to your repo so it knows to record it in here. So we have it recorded. Let me upload them to your Gemini file store for you. So if you, if it, if you have not set it up yet, it's gonna help you set that up at this point and let me use the XML to put it into your sugar agent.

So it's literally gonna, like, you just brought it the stuff back over here and it's gonna go do a lot of the work for you. And like I, I know that it seems like, uh, we, we've put this up with a little bit of training wheels right now, but once you see how this works, it, it's literally like learning, oh crap.

I like Claude can probably help me do this thing. Like whatever these tasks might be like this. So I just need to ask it and tell it in plain language. And it's more of like this orchestrator, you get to be the, the AI boss agent yourself on trying to have it go help you do this work [02:14:00] faster. Because if I had to go do all this myself manually again, it would take a lot of time.

So while this is working in the background, I can go drink a coffee or go do something else for a minute or work on something else. I can even open a new Claude code thread and start working on some other part in here that I need to, and they, they can work completely parallel to each other. It's pretty amazing.

Um, all done. All right. So Claude told me it's all done. Uh, it saved all three files into a brand voice folder that it just made right here. And then it also, uh, you'll see there, there's just like blue number four right here. When you see this, this is showing your, your repository structure here locally, and it's showing you how many new files are here local, that are different from what you have in the cloud up in GitHub.

Um, and so you can, when you have it, commit this. So like this is a signal when you start seeing a lot of number, like a, a higher number over here. It's a signal to have clog commit and document this for you. So it syncs it back to the GitHub repo in the [02:15:00] cloud. Also, it's like creating a backup. It, it's even gonna proactively try and like at different intervals ask you if you want to commit it, um, because we've taught it to do that.

But, uh, it's always good just to build your own habit too, of like committing frequently also. So you're like saving it beyond just your local store in here. Okay, so it's done this, it's also, it's using our task system and it's asking if we want to go ahead and add the Gemini file store. It's telling me to go to Google AI Studio, uh, create a new file, use this.

Um, like if you already had your N eight N stuff, we have the workflows in N eight N that will actually do this for it. Where Claude can help you do this part as well, like actually adding it over there. Um. And then for the sugar agent. So let me, let me have it do the Sugar agent, and then I'm gonna show you another way that you can actually add this stuff into the, uh, the Gemini file store in a, in like using the stacks that we showed y'all and built [02:16:00] out.

All right, Claude, thank you so much for all your help. Um, what I want you to do is let's focus on doing number two right now. Just go ahead and if you can fully customize and personalize my Sugar agent with the, the brand voice XML and add that into it and update or edit and add to the instructions any other way that we need to.

So that agent is fully personalized to me. Um, for this set and setting of also working for Hattie Bs, please go ahead and do that and then please save that back into my repo too, please. And then once you're done with that, I want you to be sure that, uh, you also get into the habit along with me and remind me to constantly keep, uh, updating documentation within the repo and committing to GitHub as well and keeping that, that all up to date, please.

So please go do the Sugar agent and then once you're done with that, go ahead and create the commit. I'm gonna do the Gemini file [02:17:00] store using the stacks front end instead of having you do it here in Claude Code, please. Thank you. Okay, so I'm gonna, I gave it my little brain dump right here. And instead of me asking before edits, I'm gonna let, I'm gonna put it in Yolo mode a little bit so y'all can see what that looks like.

So I'm gonna hit shift tab or click on this until it says edit automatically. And I'm gonna send this through. So now Claude is, is still like, Claude code is still gonna come back here and check in with me, but not, uh, not as frequently. So it created its little to-do list and it's gonna go off to the races and start working on getting all this set up for me.

So while that's happening, let me come over here and show you what this looks like. Yeah, see, this one got hung up for some reason. Lemme kill this execution. That's something y'all might run into. I, I think that this is something that's going on with N eight N today or if there, I haven't looked online to see if there's an outage or something today.

Not just with them, but just, it could be a [02:18:00] server store or something that's getting used. Because even this morning I was like, it's demo day. It's, there's always gonna be some sort of like, fun tech hiccup. And I, I was debugging it and looking through it, I'm like, there's nothing wrong on this. And it like, we think it's something that's going on, uh, elsewhere that's like affecting some of these things and, and I'm not sure, I haven't had a chance to fully like figure that out yet.

Um, okay, so if I come back over here into NAN and as part of your onboarding, Claude is gonna help you set up all these Gemini file search N eight N workflows right here. Remember, these are like the pipes that, that it's gonna put in place so that you can either have a Google Drive folder that you add things that you want to go into your, your library, either through the Google Drive folder or through the Stacks UI that we have built out, that you'll run locally in your browser.

So once Cloud has helped you set this up and set up the stacks for you, it like it will walk you through it bit by bit. We're gonna have this in the [02:19:00] Async video too. 'cause again, like the onboarding to all of this stuff just takes a little bit of time. And once you do, like, you move a lot faster. Uh, once the stacks is built, it's gonna look something like this.

It's gonna walk you through and get this all going. It's gonna spin up what's called a local host, which basically means it, it's like hosting this website on your own machine so it's not available on the open internet. And it gives us access to this interface to be able to manually add things into our library, which is the Gemini file search, um, through this U ui instead.

So that's where, like, once this is done, it's gonna ask you to add in your API key and put in your innate in, uh, webhook URLs like this. Um, and then you can proceed to go ahead and doing the rest of this work in here. Um, and, and at that point, literally like all you're gonna be doing it, it looks, it works like you, how you might think.

Uh, you're gonna click on this. You're gonna grab maybe your [02:20:00] brand voice analyses, the F fo FAQs that you have for, um, Hattie Bs, which are in the repo, and you can add to them more if you'd like to. That's something we could talk about maybe on Friday. Uh, you wanna upload those so that they're in your personal Gemini file store that are accessible to your agents in N eight N that you're working on here.

So that's where you're gonna grab the file. Um, open it. Just upload it in here. Uh, I think mine's like timed out, so it's like failing right now, but like, once it's, once it's um, like I reconnected it back up, it'll just like upload it to Gemini and show up like what it did earlier when I was doing that at the beginning of the demo.

Um, and again, just like, I'm gonna say it and y'all gonna get tired of sar not saying this, like, because it's a a p it's a habit. You need to get into that. If you hit blockers, say, I did this CLO code, set all this up for me, and then I'm like, oh, crap, I just, I did what Tyler said. It's all set up. And then I'm uploading my, my dock in here and it's like [02:21:00] airing out.

What the heck? How do I fix this? Um, what I could do then is try, like, try and upload it again, and then if it fails, try and get it screenshotted to capture any error message. Or just like, remember what it said. You can even come into the activity log if it catches some of this stuff, and like, copy this out too.

Or screenshot this, take this back over into Claude code. Give it back to it and tell it what's going on and tell it what you're doing and telling it, Hey, here's the screenshot so you can see what I'm seeing. Can you help me? Either you go fix this and debug it or help me do it. Like, whichever way that you personally wanna do this.

I'm talking about y'all wanna do this. If you wanna learn how to debug it yourself, it'll walk you through it. If you'd rather Claude just like, go fix this freaking thing, like, it'll go do it for you. Uh, and then you can come back and get this up and going. So in the same way that it helps with the setup of this stuff, it can help with the debugging and fixing of it as well.

'cause it's, it's ai it can happen sometimes when you're getting things up and [02:22:00] rolling. Um, okay, let's come back over here. This, I think this is the last thing and we can end on this. And thank y'all for, for hanging in there with us. I know that this is like a fire hose of information and it is a lot. But what we're teaching y'all, if you can absorb just even parts of this is gonna like put you a, like in the 1% of AI practitioners right now, especially this clawed code bit right here.

Mm-hmm. Um, okay. So this one ahead on, while we were doing something else, it, it added all this information. It created the commit, so it synced it up to GitHub for me. It did the sugar agent and created that and added it. So right here it even made a new section. So it made a prompt section, it made an agent section, and then it put Tyler's Hattie B sugar.

And so now if I were to go and interact with this agent right here. It's gonna sound like Tyler, the Tyler version of sugar, especially once I get this next week [02:23:00] when we show y'all how do you have sugar and add in and connect it to your, your library to be able to go and look at the brand voice analysis on top of this too.

So again, we're trying to get all the pieces in place this week to get going for next week. All right, I'm gonna take a breath and we're gonna, 

Sara: yeah guys, this is a lot and it's amazing and we went way over time, but like, hopefully you guys can see the what is absolutely possible, like when, when we actually pull together everything right?

Um, so this is gonna be worth it, I promise you the most important thing. So there's two pieces of homework, alright? The most important one is that you get set up because obviously nothing's gonna happen downstream from that. So if all you could do on Fri by Friday is getting set up, that like that is fine.

Um, as you probably can tell, Tyler and I are here to get you guys to the finish line, like we mean it. We'll stay extra time on Friday. We will get the looms and, and the [02:24:00] step-by-step and everything to you as well. We've got a ton of questions, um, which like, just give us some time 'cause we also. I wanna make sure that we cover a lot of the, the things that you ask, um, as part of what we're gonna send out so that you guys aren't hanging, but we just had, there was just so much going on.

Um, so the most important thing is that you get set up. There will be a separate like document, step by step and loom for that. And then there will be a separate part. Two of the homework will be to create your agent and personalize it with the echo, uh, thing that you just saw. And we will create a separate, like separate assets for that.

So, um, yeah, I just wanted to say thank you all also because I have to say like you guys have kept this energy going right from the beginning and I'm so proud of you guys because this is a lot. You guys don't know us. We just rocked up here and like showed you some stuff and you guys are following and you are, um, you have such a, like a growth mindset and that is gonna get you far the fact that there's like [02:25:00] almost 300 of you still hanging in there, almost three hours on, okay.

Yeah. Like, you guys are going to be phenomenal at this stuff. So just trust the process. Uh, give us some time to like, make sure that we really lock in and get everything set up right for you. Um, and trust yourselves because you can do this and we've, you know, we're here teaching you this 'cause we believe that you can do this.

Tyler: Yeah, I, I love it. And we will also add the slide deck. Um, I'll even give it to Ileana so we can email it. We'll add it and, and add it to the student repo. So we'll, we'll update the repo also, like, as you'll see, um, we'll, we'll talk about this even more, um, just so if you want to go see the slide deck along with the recording, we'll have that.

Uh, the other thing I want to give a, like quick shout out, uh, to Panda that I think was the name in here that was trying to debug, they were setting up cloud code in vs. Code, I think is what it was on their Windows machine. And they kept hitting blockers and in the chat I was like, Hey, go talk to CLO code and tell these few things and see if it can help you fix it.

And they [02:26:00] report it back when, just like, check the chat and they're like, yeah, it fixed it. So like that is the absolute proof that you, you can lean on these systems to help you get through this onboarding process. That is extremely, it's a lot like, there's no denying that. But the, the good news is too, is like once you get VS code and Claude code and like all these parts and pieces, yes you, you're gonna use them in class, but you can also start playing with this stuff extracurricularly too.

And like these tools don't go away. So you'll have them set up and installed to use on like, other things that you wanna start, you know, tinkering around with. And I guarantee you like once you do this and it clicks. It is addictive. Like you'll wanna start being like, well, what the heck can I build? Uh, kind of thing.

So, 

Sara: yeah. 

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. 

Sara: And we can't, we can't wait to, to see what you guys do with it. So thank you for bearing with us. And, uh, and like, you know, we, honestly, honestly, this felt like normal class time for us. We don't feel like we just walked into a strange like, place where we don't know anyone. This is what it's actually like for us.

So thank you guys for [02:27:00] also like, making that the energy and the space for us, um, because as you can tell, it's like really important for, for us that you guys get to the finish line that you guys like grow and you see what's possible for you. So, um, we're so like, yeah, like lots of gratitude. Lots and lots of gratitude for, for this day and the opportunity.

Um, a hundred 

Tyler: percent 

Sara: Eliana, 

Ileana: thank you. Just to, the gratitude is from us. Thank you so much for so much detail and value in the setup. I thought it was so useful, Tyler, how you did it from a quote unquote beginner's way when you were speaking to the ai. I. That was so useful and the same the way you explained the reasoning behind it and why you're doing what you're doing in the moment in between, it's gonna be so useful for the students while they watch the replay as well.

And actually, Sarah, I saved what you wrote in the chat, uh, and I wanna read it out in case people did not see it. I really think it's important. You wrote, it's normal to feel excited, overwhelmed, a little scared, empowered. This is a new way of working and your brain is being stretched. [02:28:00] So I completely agree with that.

Thank you so much for stretching the student's mind so much and presenting all of this to us. Thank you. 

Tyler: I love it. We're, we're excited. Especially like holiday season coming up, y'all are gonna be able to go brag to your family that you're, you're all like developers now. You're coders and they won't know the difference, I guarantee you.

So, 

Ileana: so what I'm gonna do is share the question submission form in the chat. Now, of course you'll have it in under the lesson of today. So if you have any questions, as Sarah and Tyler said, while you're getting the homework done, which is today's setup, of course with the same case study, submit them there and Sarah Tyler will have a look at them.

And of course, uh, I will share with you also the questions that are coming in from the q and a box to both of you. Okay. So you can have a look of those as well. And that's it. I know we're quite, uh, already quite over time, so. Thank you to all of you guys for coming in live. Thank you for staying back. You all are amazing.

Great work today. Get some rest. Good luck with doing the homework. And I will get Sarah and [02:29:00] Tyler's Loom video up on today's lesson. So it's, we're gonna be right underneath today's class recording. That's where the loom video will be. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. 

Tyler: Thank you. All right, thanks y'all. We'll see you soon.

Yes. We're gonna work on the Loom and start recording it, uh, here, like, uh, it might be this afternoon or this evening when we send it through because we, sorry. And I actually have like a team meeting with our team here in a little bit. So we'll try and get it done before then, but just in case it might be after that.

So just a quick timing, heads up there. 

Thank you so much. 

Alright, love y'all. See you soon. Thank 

you. Bye.
