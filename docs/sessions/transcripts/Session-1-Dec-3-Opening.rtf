Transcript:\
 \
Me: Let's see here. Let me make sure I've got the last little bit of my stuff toggled on. All right. Yeah, and sorry I clawed code, fixed my freaking file store thing with the web hooks. At least got it working for us to demo it, right? It wouldn't be like a webinar unless we were having, like, difficulties, like, right at the last second.  \
Them: Unless that's true. Yeah.  \
Me: That's always how it goes.  \
Them: Like the demo gods always have on us. Yes, that's very true. We've had that with other speakers as well.  \
Me: Yeah. All right.  \
Them: Would you say, just so we can also make sure we're catered to the audience, Would you say that most of the people are like, we need to kind of make it very nontechnical, or do we need to kind of like, is there a big variety of people.  \
Me: We need. To kind of.  \
Them: Is it? Big variety. But it's been stabilized because they've had two sessions with Nick Sonnenberg who taught them about N8N argentic workflows. Okay? Got it. So they've had that already. Yeah. So you can tell them, I know you've already seen an A10. And specifically what they learned was how to make a Gmail one to divide label emails and divide the emails coming in. Okay, so that's a specific one that they did. Okay, got it. All right. All right, we're right on time, so I'm going to go ahead on stage and. Yeah. Have fun. Have a good class. I'll be here. So anytime, just say ELE or a host if you don't remember my name, and then I'll come on. And Tyler. You got it with the slides? Yeah, as well as the demo.  \
Me: Yes, I'll pull those up right now. Yep.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: All right, thanks. Guy. Thanks, guys. All done. All done.  \
Me: All right. Make it this. Okay? Where's. My. Slide deck.  \
Them: Kick this month off. Today we're going to begin with something, as you guys are saying, really, really exciting. It's a brand new series and I say series because we're going to have four classes with this amazing people and we're going to be shifting into one of the most practical, high impact parts. Of this program, which is using AI agents to build systems that deliver measurable business value. So in this series, you're going to learn how to create automations that integrate AI at strategic points inside your workflow. So it's going to be an enhancement to your systems. You'll be working with N8N automations, which you already know the base level of, and you're going to learn where and how to insert AI modules.  \
Me: System. Which. You already have.  \
Them: And agent steps to generate business value. So this essentially, it's all about designing systems that work reliably, repeatedly, and, of course, with AI as a force multiplier for your existing processes. And we are so very fortunate to have two incredible teachers leading this series.  \
Me: To. Do. Essentially.  \
Them: Sarah and Tyler Sarah Davidson is the co founder of AI Build Lab and she is a leading voice in AI powered personal branding and human centered design. She has a background in communication strategy and business development and she's helped thousands of entrepreneurs scale their influence. She has so much knowledge in the field and she also has so much experience in teaching and training. She's taught thousands in live workshops. She's educated more than 10,000 people, and she has graduated more than thousands agentic practitioners. And Sarah is joined by Tyler Fisk, who is a serial entrepreneur. He's a recognized thought leader in agentic AI and he's a co founder of AI Build Labs. Of course. Together with Sarah and Tyler has over 20 years of experience turning startups into scalable, high growth companies. He has done this over and over again, including growing his very small $72 family business into eight figures. So together, Sarah and Tyler bring a powerful combination of strategy, clarity and hands on AI agentic expertise. And actually their mission really aligns with what you are all here to looking for in this AI Mastery program. And that is to make AI accessible, useful and powerful for people who want to lead with it in the next era.  \
Me: So much. Knowledge in the field. And trick. Sense. Of people. Graduate. Thousands of. Just. Direct. Ly tyler. Fisk. A serial. Recogn. Izement. Is over 20 years of experience trying to disturb. Exper. Tise. With. What you have here. So looking forward. To.  \
Them: So with that, let's begin. And please join me in giving a big, big, big warm welcome to Sarah Davidson and Tyler Fisk. Hey, everyone. So great to be here. Thank you, Intro. I love the energy in class already. This is so amazing, guys. And Marie, I see you. I feel like we have people that we kind of know us, so that's pretty cool to also walk into.  \
Me: Yeah. Love this. Excited. We have been looking forward to this.  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah, our goal, like Tyler said, is to get you guys to the finish line. So even though we're going to go through a lot of things and you guys are going to learn a lot, your mind's going to be stretched for sure. Our goal is to get everybody to the finish line. And for the people who know us in the chat, like, they know that we keep to our word around that. So even though it might feel like we're going through a lot, we have you covered. We're going to be going through a lot of what we're going to be doing to support you guys to make sure that everybody gets to the finish line. I really love the energy in the chat. I feel like you are people, so I feel very comfortable. Thank you for that. So, Tyler, do you want to share your screen and we can kick into things because we have a lot to work through today.  \
Me: Yeah, there we go.  \
Them: All right.  \
Me: Cool.  \
Them: So, you guys, I don't know if you know this, but you're going to be building a whole entire customer service agent department. We're actually going to be building multiple agents. That work together on your behalf. To resolve complex customer service issues. And I want to also preface this by saying that even though we're saying customer service department, that just happens to be the vehicle or the use case, that you're going to be working to what you're going to learn with us, you can apply the mental models, the frameworks of what you're going to learn into anything you want into your business. I know people are working within companies. People are going and doing AI implementation agencies. People got their own businesses. So wherever you're coming in from, You can take what you learn here and apply it. It's not just customer service department. And we have. We're lucky enough to be given four sessions with you guys. So Eliana said, please be very clear with everybody what we're going to expect from you. Okay, so let me start by saying that the four sessions. So we've split the actual demo and the doing work into two parts, right? So today is going to be all the foundational stuff that you need to build your department. And then so we're going to be, you know, going through all of that today. And we're going to walk you through that. We're going to hold your hand through the process. And even if you're like, you know, if you're watching the demos and things like that, we will follow up with loom videos and material step by step, instructions that you guys can follow. Beyond the course you're going to. Guys are going to have some homework to do. Friday session is going to be a Q and A session and troubleshooting session and anything goes session. Friday session is all about you. All right? So Friday session, you are going to have time to, like, you know, go through the, the demos and your homework and get everything set up. And Ileana is going to also send you a Google form in case you get stuck, in case there's something that you need us to troubleshoot, and you're going to drop your questions in that form. And then Friday, we're going to, like, walk in and make sure that everybody's all set up, ready to go. And then part two. Happens next week. On Wednesday where we're going to pull together the whole entire agent department, the whole entire agentic team. So we're going to introduce you to them today and we're going to set up the foundations today. But next week we're going to put them all together and then you're going to. Have that to graduate with and we'll have also follow on session beyond that on the following Friday as well, just to help you troubleshoot. So, Tyler, do you want to introduce ourselves first? I feel like we just really, really kind of, like, went really down the rabbit hole really quick.  \
Me: You're good. Well, I mean, we've got a lot to cover today, so we'll keep our intro short. Iliana did an amazing job. So, Sara Davidson, Tyler Fisk. We've been in this space for several years now. Both of us would consider ourselves non technical in this space, so if you're in this class. Our big thing we say at AI Build Lab, which is our companies, that we're in the business of possibilities. Of what this tech now unlocks is you to be able to build things that you would have never thought possible before. And even these new methodologies and frameworks that we're going to be teaching in here takes that up a whole nother level. So it's going to be a lot of fun. We come at this from a position of practitioners as well. So Sara and I have not just been, like, theorizing on this stuff. Over the last several years, we've been teaching, we've been consulting, we've been building and developing this stuff for live clients. From small Main street businesses all the way up to Fortune 50 companies and everything in between. So we say that because a lot of what we're going to walk you through is going to feel very practical, and it's our goal to make this accessible and to show you that it is possible. Because both of us, and it's very common even in our community, we see it, people suffer from impostor syndrome, especially in this tech. And we want to normalize that and say, hey, ask the questions. We're here to help you. And I promise you that you're going to get there. You just got to keep trying, keep showing up on this stuff.  \
Them: Yeah, for sure. And also, you should also know that 90% of the students who come through our programs are not technical. I'm not technical. And I teach this stuff. I build this stuff. We have clients all across the board, so we also want to normalize that. You're going to learn a lot. And if you feel like you don't belong in the room, I promise you, you belong in the room. And we always deliver on our promise, which we're going to get everybody to the finish line. And people who know us in the chat know that to be true about us. And don't worry for the people who are like, I wish I had more time. And in between sessions and things like that, we're here to make sure you get to the finish line. So we will, you know, extend our sessions and things like that on, like, Fridays to make sure that you get there. We're committed to that. So by the end of these two sessions, the Monday, the Friday, and the sessions both Mondays and Fridays, No, sorry. Wednesdays and Fridays, guys, you will have a working AI Agent, customer service department. But the real skill that you're going to be using is using AI to build AI systems. We're going to take this to a very different level. Where instead of getting bogged down by the tooling and having to figure out, oh, my gosh, I've got to learn this new tool. And, oh, my Gosh, is it N8N today and is it Lindy tomorrow, and is it, like, all these different things? We're going to actually take you to 8D. I saw Marie put that in the chat. Marie obviously knows us. The Eighth Dimension. And we're going to get AI to build the system for us. What you're going to learn is how to describe what you want. And so. And getting the AI to build the system for you. So imagine what kind of possibility that that app opens up for you, especially if you're someone like me, who's not technical, who go. Who goes. Oh my gosh, look at all these squiggly lines. Right? Imagine what can that impact on your business, on the way that you work, all of it. What becomes possible for you if you can literally speak things into existence by knowing how to, like, ask for something. And having the AI system created for you. So that is where our aim is, to get you guys. To. And, Tyler, if you want to go to the next slide, Tyler's driving the slides today because we have quite a few demos, and so instead of us going backwards and forwards between screen shares, he's doing this driving the slides and the demo. And any of your questions that do come up, guys. Just put them in the chat. I will. Because today is very demo heavy. This is what's going to happen if you ask a question and I feel like we already know we're going to answer it. Down the track I won't interrupt the flow. If it is relevant and if I think a lot of people are getting stuck, like, what the heck's a repo. Okay, we're going to stop and we're going to explain that. And then, well, I'm going to also screenshot everything and make sure that I have the questions covered in the end, because we're going to have some questions at the end time. So what you're going to learn today, the whole customer, the agent department that you're, you're going to be building. We actually. We teach this in a highly intensive course, Merinos. This in four weeks, okay? You're going to learn it in essentially four sessions. Two sessions, if you think about the theory and then application and things like that. And because we wanted you guys to, like, that's the amount of time we have together. And we knew that was really important for you guys to have something that you. It's tangible for you, that you can use and deploy in your. Own work, what we have done. Is we have built the architecture, so we have build the infrastructure. So instead, if you're doing, like coming with us in four weeks, I'm learning. Oh, the prompt engineering and then writing the system instructions and building the agents and learning parameters and learning all the things that will get you to the full identic. Department for four weeks. We've built the infrastructure for that. So you guys can just leverage the infrastructure, as in, we've built all of that stuff that you need to know or do, and then you guys can leverage that to actually essentially speak into the workflow, into existence. But there is a place that we need to get you there, for you to be able to do that.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: And everything that you learn around that, the templates and everything like that, you can keep and customize to other workflows for your work down the track as well. Tyler, do you want to mention anything about that?  \
Me: I was going to say too. I know. Even hearing the fact of wow, you all can condensed four week curriculum into a couple of teaching sessions is that. I even saw people like, is that even possible? Well, we're going to figure this out. Mainly SR Was saying the way that we've built this and the approach that we're teaching this in here, where you're going to become more of an orchestrator of agents, which is different. This is like what we have been teaching over the last year, plus taken to the next level and using new tools to actually do this work. So it's going to be a lot of fun, and I think it's going to be possible, too, just because of what we're going to be using. This system and the methodology. Of Claude Code and VS code and Claude Desktop to get all of this stuff into production, into innate in it is not only going to help you and educate you along the way, but it'll help you actually set up and build all this stuff. Which is pretty wild. So a lot we're going to be doing today here in a minute is going to be around the setup for sure.  \
Them: Yeah. It is so. Yeah. And. And, Tyler, do you want to make a quick message about the setup? Because I know some people might have gone through that process and some people might not have, and that's totally okay. So we just want to validate that. Do you want to mention something, Tyler, about that?  \
Me: Yeah. So here in a minute. There was some emails that Ilana and the Mindvalley team, I think, sent out that were telling you all some of the different things you wanted to try and have set up and installed or ready coming into today's session. Again. We're going to go through it all again step by step today. It's going to be fast because of time. We're going to shoot a loom video after this class to make sure we cover any questions and do it again so you can watch it again in a different format of end to end walkthrough there. And we have Friday as well to answer any questions and unblock anyone here, because once you get this initial, it's almost like Sahara describes this. Once we get the workshop set up of all of these tools that we need to build the bots, to build the agents, then the system. Is designed to help you along the way. To help move it along. No matter where you're at in your understanding of this stuff, you can just talk to it in plain language and it'll help you keep moving forward.  \
Them: And I think someone asked, like, but can we actually understand what's happening behind the scenes? And yeah, we're going to take you through that so that you. That is super important. We don't want you just clicking a button and not understanding why something is being built because we want you to know how things work behind the scenes so that you have a real clear understanding of what good looks like, so. That's part of what we're going to be doing. So we assume because we're the new kids on the block, right. That in your mastery journey so far, that you've learned about prompt, engineering, context, engineering, you've learned about parameters like temperature. Don't worry about if you. If this sounds like a little bit foreign, you can still do this without it. You've been probably working with AI assistants and some basic innate and stuff. And today we're going to introduce you to new terms, okay? That is going to be important for you to understand how to build an agent department. A whole entire AI Department that does things for you. So the first key thing for you to know is that we are going from assistance to agent. An assistant is like ChatGPT. You know, it doesn't work until you actually instruct it to work. But if you're not part of the process, nothing happens. An agent is kind of like having an AI employee that can reason, plan, and execute on your behalf. And the very cool thing is that you can build an entire team of agents. That act like a department, like, exactly like a customer service department. So Bob knows what's happening with Jim, and they can collaborate and they can figure out, oh, this customer is pissed. Let's send this message. Or they ask for this information. Let's find the right information so they collaborate like an entire team, okay? And in order for them to know what they're working on and what is relevant to your business, We are also introducing this concept queue called retrieval augmented generation, which is just a fancy word. For essentially creating a knowledge base. So AI has access to all the information in the world, but it doesn't have context on your own business, on your policies, your procedures, all of that. So as part of this process, we're going to teach these agents or teach AI about your company so that when you get a customer service email or whatever, it generates the information that is relevant to your company. We also teach about human in the loop. This is a very important part of our philosophy around this. It's because you're building an entire team where you're giving these agents the ability to be like, to have autonomy, to act on your behalf. You want to have assurance that you are approving the tasks that it does for you. So we always have this, like, human checkpoint in the process, and you build. That level of confidence in the system over time. You don't just, like, hey, let's just, like, chuck an agent out in the wild and hope for the best. That's not how we roll. We might hear us Talk about orchestration. Or like, building an orchestrated agentic workflow. And that's essentially when you have multiple agents acting and collaborating together. So they're working together like a department, like a team, like a task force. That is the orchestration. And I'm sure you've probably come across mcps, but these are essentially like, the API for those of you who are more technical, but giving the agents like superpowers to access tools and data and information to be able to go and execute on your behalf. Right. So, Tyler, is there anything that you want to add to it?  \
Me: No, this is awesome. Thank you. We're trying to set the glossary of terms that you're going to hear us say, but at any time as we go through this stuff, if you all hear us say a phrase or some sort of a term and you don't know what that means, please drop that. Into the chat. We're trying to detec bro this stuff as best as we can and make it understandable.  \
Them: Yeah. All. Right. So what we're going to do, okay, I think that you guys get the vision, so I'm going to go through it pretty quickly about what you're going to be building, but we're going to go into the demo. We want you guys to see the end project. In action, right? And then we're going to deconstruct backwards. We're going to go. Okay. Now that we've seen how these agents collaborate and work together as a department, let's set up the workshop. Right. Let's get you guys set up, and we'll go through it. And like I said, This is going to be pretty fast because we're live, but we will send out a loom video with more detailed step by steps after the session. For you guys to follow with instructions. We very much like hold your hand through the process. And then we're going to demo the building the brain. So this is the knowledge base that's going to provide the expert advice or the expertise on your business. And we want to make sure that your customer service department doesn't sound like AI like a robot. It sounds like your brand. Right. So we're going to show you how to do that. We're going to provide all of the tooling around that. And then we're going to give you some homework to do. So that you can put. Start putting the foundations together, and then you're ready for week two, which is when we're going to build the entire department. Okay? All right. So we're chosen Random shop to demo.  \
Me: We're not that random. It is like AI.  \
Them: Okay, okay.  \
Me: So that's for me. And it's Nashville, so I'm from Tennessee all. And this is one of my favorite restaurants, so it's random, but yeah.  \
Them: Okay? All. Right. Okay, so what is happening is that we're. We're building a customer service department for hadd bees as a case study to show you guys, okay? This is an incredibly advanced thing that you guys are going to do, and so what we want you to do is actually go through the reps with us already. Providing you with the. The information, the infrastructure and everything. Okay? So we want you. We want to give you a real world example, not just a made up, right? So you, you can see exactly how the pieces fit together. And then we want you to do the reps. So once you go through the whole step by step process of how you do it for a business, then you can customize it to your own business, own or any other use case. It doesn't have to be customer service, but it's really, really important that you guys have the scaffolding, the infrastructure to help you go through and get the reps, and then you can take it wherever you guys want to go. So Howdy Bees is going to be our case study. And you'll get to know them a little bit. You want to mention anything about how to be Tyler? I don't know.  \
Me: I mean, they started as, like, a small Nashville hot chicken joint, and now they have locations all over the country. I freaking love them. They're amazing. So if you ever have the chance, definitely eat them. Or eat them. Eat with them. Check them out. The vibe is also really cool. Plus, what we're building here is like, congratulations, all of y'all. Picked up this second side gig of working as a customer service rep or an internal team member on the Hattie B's team during this course to try and think about how would I build this stuff. And because we don't have all their internal information. Because this is just a case study, right? All of the information that we use to build this is publicly accessible.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: So even the fact of where we're able to get this thing to adjust, that is pretty wild. And when we're saying that we want all of us to be singing to the same hymnal here and all working the same case study, that helps us get the build repetition. We have a strong belief that it's easier to pick this stuff up and learn by building and learning, that through repetition. I personally am like a very kinetic type learner. That's one of the best ways that I pick things up. And so that's the same kind of way that we teach here.  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Me: The other thing is, everything that you're building in here, you're getting this in a repo, and you're going to learn the process to do this. And this will make more sense to you probably in a maybe next week. But this is creating an entire system level shot prompt example. And what that means is once you build this thing out end to end, you now have that to use this methodology of giving it to Claude code, giving it like the claw desktop app to be like, hey, here's an example of an agentic set of agentic workflows that we build. I want you to look at this to use it as inspiration and then go build this completely new workflow for me and it can look at how we put this together and learn from that to build something net new. Which is a lot of fun.  \
Them: Yeah. Okay? I want to cover. Look, there's a lot of confusion around reps. Thanks, guys. Anytime. It doesn't make sense. Just say it. Because we are like we're in our own zones, okay? When I we say we want you to get the reps on Hattie Bees, it means we want you to practice the repetition of what it's like to build a customer service department for honeybees. We want you to go through the step by step process. Without giving you the like. Your mind will be blown if you have to do this and contextualize it to your business out the gate. We want this to be easy for you. So we want you to go through the motions. Of going through the step by step with us on a case study. And then once you've had the repetitions and you're confident with the process, you can apply it and take it wherever you. You want to take it to. Okay, so that's the. That's on reps, and I'm sure we mentioned repo. You will hear us say repo over and over again. Probably Tyler's going to say it more than me. Repo. Think of it as like a shared Google Drive. Which has got, like, all this information for building stuff. Okay, so that's what a repo is. So, yeah, do check us on the terminology, because sometimes we're just in our own heads. So the rent the roadmap for how we're going to do this. Okay. This session is about getting the workshop set up. We're going to get everything set up that we need. To be able to build this agent department to be able to build these AI employees. And as a baseline, we're going to build an AI employee, like an expert, say, that is trained on the Heidi B business. Remember how we said we need, we need a customer service department? But for Heidi B, it's not for all of the information on the Internet, for Hattie B's for their policies. For their procedures, for their brand voice, how they do things right. And we're going to teach the AI employee, we're going to train it on the information. So we're going to connect it to a brain. Or the knowledge base. And we're going to make sure that it reflects the Heidi B. Brand voice. So your company brand voice. Think about that way and your own brand voice as if you're. You were a customer service representative working for Heidi B's, but we're creating the AI Version of you. Okay, so that's session one is we're going to set up the employee, the. The kind of workshop. We're going to get everything put together, and then next week we're going to go into building the other team members and the departments and we're going to pull them all together. In a workflow, like they're going to collaborate together. And they're going to be exactly like you see people, if they're, like, in a department like, hey, Bob, we just got this, like, angry email from someone, or the chickens, like, not cooked or whatever, right? And so we have to go. And then it passes the information on to Sue. Sue goes and checks the knowledge. Base. She makes sure that how we're going to respond. Responds in the right way. So that that's the kind of idea and we're going to go through the team. In a minute. So this is the agentic team that you're going to be building. Okay, So. We like to be a little bit. If you probably figure it out, we're pretty casual about this. You're going to hear us. People say, don't anthropomorphize A.I. like, they're always like, no, don't make A.I. is not human. Okay? We're going to be. The people who do that because it honestly makes the most sense. You. You will understand the process that when we, like, think through how we hire people, what information we give them, how we measure their performance, it's kind of like having a team member for sure. Okay. And we like to have fun with it. So our agents have funny names. And so the agents that we're going to be working with today. Tyler, do you want to actually introduce the agents? Because I feel like I've been talking a lot.  \
Me: I got you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So like Sarah said, all these agents, they have fun things. I'll give you the background and then also kind of, like, give the bucket of what that kind of agent is. Cinemon is the quick, funny story about that is because of my accent. I'm from the south when I say sentiment analysis. And if I don't enunciate really well and it gets transcribed, it frequently comes out as cinnamon. And so I'm also a Big Bang Theory, like that TV show a huge fan of that show because I'm a nerd. And Raj on that show has a little dog in his dog's name is Cinnamon. And every time he calls the dog, he's like, cinnamon. So I'm like, that is the name for my sentiment analysis agent. And that's what you all get, too. So this is like, think about this as an email comes in, because we're building this customer service email workflow. If a person was doing this, we would read that email and we would vibe check it. Right. We would be trying to understand what's the emotions conveyed, what are they not saying? But we can kind of read between the lines on. All of that sort of stuff. That's what Cinemon is doing. And you're going to get that agent as a part of this. Really quick. I saw Elena. You had your hand up or raised up? I want to make sure that we get you real quick for we keep going. If you just want to unmute and ask, I think if you're able to on here.  \
Them: So they're not able to unmute Tyler and Sarah. But we can promote people as panelists if you like, but you can invite them for something quick to share in the chat.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Yeah, I think I see that. Questions? Probably. It may be easier if I filter the questions to you, Tyler, because everything.  \
Me: Pop up. That's why I wanted to flag that. So, yeah, if you all just want to drop them in, chat right now, if you can, and then we'll address them as we keep going.  \
Them: Right. Yep.  \
Me: I'll just keep working on the roster here.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Hatch is just like, a fun branding name, because Hot Chicken and Hatch, like, I think you guys can connect the dots there. That's our expert agent. The expert agent is like, think of this as when you get an email coming in. And like, in a lot of businesses, it's not always the customer service rep that knows the answer to the question, they might have to go check in with some other people on their team to get all the information they need to then go back or check a knowledge base or check FAQs or something like that. To then go back and answer or write that email. So, in the same way that you might see that play out in the real world, we have a separation of duties here in the agents here also. So Hatch is our All Things Hatties expert. And it is also connected to another little agent, which we'll talk about more here in a minute, called the Librarian. So the librarian houses all of the information in Hattie B's knowledge base, so Hatch has its own expertise. And an email comes in. Cinema does the sentiment analysis vibe check. It passes that over to Hatch. Hatches. The expert is looking at the email. It knows it's not talking to the customer, it's working amongst the AI team. It looks or it sends a message to the librarian agent to be like, hey, here's what I'm thinking. Someone asked about do we have gluten free options on the menu? Librarian, can you go check through our knowledge base to double check and give me back anything that would be helpful for me to answer? This and pass on down the line. And then it does that, and it hands it over to Sugar. So sugar is like. The stereotypical Southern, hey, sugar like waitress. Basically, that's the Persona that we built into here. This is our email copywriting agent. So think of this like we built this from a template that we use frequently called you've Got Mail. And it's made to be a really good customer service email agent. And so when it gets the information from cinema and from the expert Agent Hatch, Sugar then thinks about this. Writes that accessible, empathetic on brand, at the brand level voice and even at you as like a person. If you want it to sound like. If I wanted to sound like me, Tyler working as an employee for Hattie B's, I could do that. And I could bake that brand voice into the sugar agent. If I wanted to. So that's what's happening there. Bishop. The name on that is the Bishop family. They're the ones who launched and founded Hattie B's. So you're going to find out that we have this framework called the Toast method, which we'll touch on here in a minute, and that involves using evaluations or evals and the Bishop. Agent is the boss agent in this sense. It's not necessarily the total boss, but it's like the quality control agent. It looks at the work that the other agents have done to this point and it's either going to rubber stamp it and say, yep, that's good, or call out what it's done. Well, what it's done wrong. And then it's going to pass that back to the sugar agent to revise something. And then the last one is going to be the hauler agent. Probably just because if I say that word, it sounds funny and it's like holler. It's hollering at you over in Slack to let us know that people know because. That's the agent we would be interacting with. So the experience of when this agentic team works together is a new email hits the Hattie B's Email Customer Service Email.  \
Them: I think that's the next slide, Tyler. It shows. Yeah, I think it shows. Yeah. There we go.  \
Me: Okay? There we go. Thank you. Yeah. So there's an incoming email. Cinema on looks at it and is like, what's the temperature? The sense of bit analysis? Does the full vibe check? It then is going to pass it to the expert agent, which is the Hatch agent. And it's like, what do we know about this? Do I know in my expertise? And what do we have in our knowledge base that I can go and grab? To help pass forward to the sugar agent. That is going to write the customer email. So it's the one that's actually going to do that copywriting. It writes the v1 version of the email. It doesn't know that it's writing the V1 version. It thinks that it's going ahead and responding back to the customer. But it's v1 version then gets passed to the Bishop agent, which is the quality assurance agent. And it's going through an entire rubric going like, hey, is this good enough? What did it do right? What did it do wrong? Is it ready to go ahead and send, or are there revisions that need to be made and it might send it back to the sugar agent to do some more work? Once we get to a finalized, like, rubber stamped version. It, then sends it to the hauler agent. The hauler agent then looks at all of this and pings us in slack. So if I work for Hattie B's, I don't have to be checking my inbox anymore. I have a whole AR team that's doing that. It's reasoning through it, it's riding the email. And then it sends me a message in Slack and it's like, hey, Tyler, here's an email that we just got. Here's how the team thought about it. Here's the draft that we wrote. Does this sound good to you or not? Or is there some changes you want us to make? And Holler has a really fun personality, so it's almost like an executive assistant coming in and doing this. But with swagger.  \
Them: Y. Eah. And. Oh, sorry. Did you?  \
Me: No, you're good. Then all of a sudden, and then we just talked to a person in slack like a team member and are like, yep, that's great. Please go ahead and just send it on. We don't have to use any special phrases. We just talk to it. Or if there's an edit or a revision that we want to have made, we just tell it that, and then we'll go back and revise it and bring it back again. And this feedback loop right here. But ultimately it's able to then go take action on our behalf. But holler. Coming into Slack is what we call a human in the loop. Checkpoint. That is such a big deal. If we did not have this in place and have it with a check in, especially at the beginning of a workflow that we build, then all of these agents could just do their work and then auto send it back to the customer without any oversight. And that is a recipe for disaster. You have to work your way up to that level of agency and you're going to get there. But this human and loop checkpoint is a huge reason that you will have success if you implement that versus like, if you've seen the write ups about that of a lot of AI projects have failed, and I have a lot of theories about that, but this is one of them. It's like they're not doing this.  \
Them: Yeah. AI agents gone a rogue, basically.  \
Me: You got it.  \
Them: And to answer a few of your questions. Okay, so I still. I love the energy and the excitement. Keep that going. So there's a few questions like, hey, why don't you just build one agent that does everything? Because you're not going to get the level of depth and specialization. That you really need to make this function like a whole agentic team. In the same way, like, if you had a customer service department, right? And it was a large customer service department, or it was like a marketing. I'm going to go outside of customer service, just so you know, right? So if you had a whole big initiative, right, and you had a task force. You would like you having a different number of specialists who are specialized in different things. That no different things that are specialized in different things that can actually bring in their specializations to help solve a problem versus one person who just, like, knows everything, right? But in saying that. Okay, so often you guys are asking advanced questions here, so we'll go there. But when Tyler and I built agency workflows, In the same way that when you have a big initiative, right? And you can hire all these specialists. They can all know their job. But it could be chaos if they don't. They're not coordinated. So often we have a boss agent. We call it a router agent. That actually manages the agents and divvies up the tasks and checks on quality control and makes sure that all the agents are doing their jobs and we're getting the thing delivered. So it might feel like in some cases that you're just working with one boss agent. But that boss agent has an entire team working under it that it's coordinating with. So that's why we do, like the specializations and then the boss agent, but. And then I think the second question was around, like, does this work outside of Slack? Yes. Slack just happens to be for this demo as our commute. Like the way that we've built this to be communicated to. But you can build it however you want. Like it can be Gmail or like SMS notification, I guess, or whatever, as long as you have tech.  \
Me: Yeah. Microsoft Teams. Yeah. So we had to pick a stack to teach to. Right. But think of these as, like, modular components that could be swapped out. And, yeah, you could use WhatsApp or there's all sorts of different. All of these modular pieces you could swap with your personal preference. And I would suggest just to make it easy on yourself. Like, use the stack that we've picked for class to just try and build with that if possible. And then after the fact, you could think about how would you adapt that to your own tech stack after that?  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Me: And then also like Sara went into router and orchestration mode just to kind of level set of what we're going to be building and where you can take it from here. We're going to be getting this to a point where it gets to production and we have the human in the loop. Checkpoint. We couldn't condense all of the advanced stuff of where you would take this to after that, but building an orchestration agent, A full eval database that runs evaluations, even agents that watch the agents and do a continuous feedback loop to self improve the system. Is possible. And that's what I was alluding to. And I was saying, once you get it to this point, you can scale that level of agency. But just for the scope of this class. We're going to get it up to that point, but not going beyond that, I guess, is the best way to put it.  \
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah. I have a whole bunch of like, private Q and A questions. Like. So, yes, the Mechanism, like the SMS, WhatsApp messenger phone. Yes. You can even have a phone agent call you. It's, it's like, it can work whatever, as long as you can connect the tech space pieces. Right? That's the, the. The pieces that need to make it work. And in terms of Holler, Holler doesn't send the email. It sends you. First of all, it's. It kind of does a check with you, so it, like, goes, okay, the whole team. So we got a really piss customer because chicken wasn't cooked or something. Don't sue me like hide. I'm just coming up with a hard like example, right? And then we want to make sure that we, like, are managing that situation. Right? Because it could be a whole PR disaster, Right? So then the whole team will go and do the thinking and do the like. This is how we need to respond. These are our policies. This is our brand voice. Holler brings it to you. And say, hey, is this a great. Is like, is this an adequate response? Is this correct? Do we want to change anything? And you in that and then you're the check to then send that out to the customer to get the agent team to send that to the customer.  \
Me: Yes, if you approve it, the hauler agent will go and actually release or send the email on your behalf via Gmail is what we're going to be building this in. But again, that could be swap for Outlook or whatever you use for email provider there. But yes, it is the checkpoint, it's the interactive agent that you're going to be working with here.  \
Them: Yeah. And while Tyler's pulling up the demo, I will answer a question about, like, it would be great to have a dashboard metrics KPI as well to track performance. Yes. We are like, we can't fit that whole big. Like, that's a whole entire course. On evaluating your agent's performance. But, yes, that is part of, like, if you have kind of, like, you have a people team, right? You have KPIs, you're like, hey, Bob's like, scored a three out of five in his response. Why is it not a five out of five? Let's coach Bob on. How about five out of five? Looks like. So that's called evals evaluation process. So that is what we do. And to answer your question, But that's not like, what we can teach to in like. Yeah, two sessions.  \
Me: In a short amount of time. Yeah. All right, so let's come in here and let's look underneath the hood so we have a sense of what we're trying to build to in here. So can everybody. Sorry, can you see ARC browser in CDN 8 in on my screen share now?  \
Them: I can.  \
Me: There we go. Fireworks.  \
Them: See. Well. I can see n8m. Yeah.  \
Me: All right, cool. All right, so this right here, this is going to be the NAN cloud version. This is where we're going to deploy all of these agents and agentic workflows to here in a minute. Or over the coming days, I should say. And so quickly, I want to just, like, walk through how all of this works. So the actual email system itself is going to.  \
Them: Oh, Tyler, can you make it a little bit bigger? Or not.  \
Me: Yeah. Let's see.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Is. Crap. Hold on. All right. Can we see that better now? Hopefully. Okay.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: All right, so when an email comes in, like, we need to have what I like to call a generative filter. This is an email classification filter. And so in my example that I have like a built out and already set up on my account, This is watching my Tyler AI Build Lab email in Gmail. Obviously, it's not Hattie B's, but if I send an email in here and it determines through this AI classification system that it is a customer service email for Hattie B's, it will tag it as such. Log it in Google sheets so that we have record keeping all along the way. And it determines what's the customer's email. If it was, it sends it onto the cinnamon agent to get it over into the actual email pipeline. The reason for doing this is that, like, even if this was the actual Hattie B's email inbox that we were hooking this up to, they might get things like newsletters or spam or all of that sort of stuff that hits their inbox, or just, like, an internal email, let's say. And they don't want this AI agent team firing off on that. A. Because, like, they're not. We're putting boundaries around, like, what they can answer and what they can't answer. And we want to save tokens. Right? Like, every time these workflows run, they cost us money and AI credits. And so we want to make sure that we're being diligent. About that, too. So this first. This is like, the first step in the process. A new email comes in, it hits this generative filter, and we can get into this more a little bit later if, like, people have questions. But I just want to go through it quickly now. It pulls the email, it parses it in, it logs it, it classifies it as the type of email. And then it's going to like, if it passes the test, it'll send it on over to Cinemon and that will then kick over to the AI agent team. The next thing that's going to happen is this. This is a big workload, so I'm going to zoom in a little bit tighter here. This is like the second part of the process. So if it passes go on that generative filter, it then brings all that information over into this agentic workflow where we're going to set some different parameters at the beginning of this N8N process. It's going to go back and actually tag the email, as in process in Gmail, so that we can keep a tracking system in Gmail, too, of, like, where an email might be in this pipeline. It feeds it to our cinema agent to do the sentiment analysis. It then takes that and passes it over to Hatch. Hatch is going to be connected to both the short term memory. The librarian, which is the RAG database. And it's even going to have exa, a web research tool over here that it's going to be able to search on. It then takes that information. All of that gets passed over to Sugar. Sugar is our email copywriting agents the one that's going to actually write the email.  \
Them: Tyler. Sorry to cut your flow, but can you collapse a sidebar just so that people can see?  \
Me: Yep, there we go.  \
Them: Yeah. Thank you.  \
Me: Sorry. Yeah. So then it's like Sugar is going to write the actual email. It, then is going to take it and pass it over to Bishop. And again it like updates the tag in gmail of where it is in the status. Bishop then does QA on it to determine, you know, is this good, does it need revisions or not? And then we kind of hit this fork in the road if it passes qa, and it's good to go ahead and move forward. It goes ahead and prepares it for store and sends it down this upper path. If QA is needed, it then sends it back to the sugar agent for revision. The revision is marked as complete. Bishop reviews it one more time. And then we then determine if it passes the second QA or not. And then it's tagging it as if it was approved. It logs it into Google Sheets, and we tell Holler about it. Holler now, pings us in slack and lets us know. So I know I'm, like, moving through this quick. There's a lot of moving parts, and there's some nodes. I'm not even going through here. At this stage, but I just kind of want to, like you all, see the general flow of this. And the other thing I want to call out is that I did not have to build this system. And this is like, what you're only going to learn.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: I laid out what I wanted to happen and I documented that really well. That's what we're going to do when we get into Claude Coat and VS code here in a minute. And then that system built this for me. So it put together, it can even go and build this, edit it, update it, ship it into N8N on my behalf. So that's what we're saying. Like, you're going to be able to put together a really complex workflow, even like this. With almost very little knowledge of how NADN works yet. Like, you don't have to. It removes that friction in here, which is kind of the amazing part.  \
Them: Yeah. And that's like, we wanted to show you behind the scenes. And. And like, we're also saying. That in order for you to get there, there is a setup that's required. We're. We've done all of the, like, infrastructure pieces. That make this possible? But you have to get set up in the right way so you can use the infrastructure in the way that we're describing.  \
Me: Yep. So. So at this, like, point in the agentic flows, because, as you can see, like, this is a system. There's a lot of components in here.  \
Them: Okay? Yep.  \
Me: And there's a lot of moving parts. So at this stage, the agents would have gotten the email, it would have passed go, they would have thought about it, written it, Holler would have now pinged us over in Slack. We would have been like, if we time block and say we want to go answer emails, you know, in the morning, in the evening, We go back in Slack and look at all of our holler messages and begin to respond to them and say, yep, this looks good. Go ahead and send us email. No, like this one needs this revision. Please do that and then bring it back to me. To actually make that happen. We have another generative filter here. This is like the workflow two of this, where when we respond in Slack, That comes back over here to an intent classifier type agent that understands. Did we say in plain language that, yep, this is good to go ahead and send on via Gmail, or did we say that we wanted some sort of revision done? Or is it coming back? And it read. It got this. This workflow was triggered by some sort of a confirmation message. Coming back from the hauler agent. These are like the different paths it could see. And if so, it's routing it back to different workflows. Like, if it determined that, we said, yep, go ahead and send it. It'll actually go ahead and send that email for us or respond to that email for us in Gmail. Update all of this stuff in Google Sheets. And then ping us back in Slack to confirm and say, hey, I just want to let you know we went ahead and sent that email for you and it's done. If we did a revision, it sends it to a different workflow that does a subroutine that does a revision on that and sends it back to us in Slack again from the hauler agent. And if it is a confirmation step where it recognizes that it was just the hauler agent telling us, hey, I sent you that email. We're good to go. That could potentially also trigger this workflow. And so we need to account for that. It basically will just, like, gracefully kill the flow and not. Like get into a continuous loop in here. Okay? And then another part of this would be. This is like the sub workflow of the revision. So if we told it that we needed an edit, if we told the hauler agent that it sends it back to this workflow where it goes back to Hatch, back to Sugar, back to Bishop, and then it sends it back. To us in slack. That's what's happening here. Same thing on this library and tool. This is the agent that is connected as the rag knowledge base Agent. That has all of the Hattie B's information in the vector stores, like in the. In the. The AI Second brain, if you want to think of it like that. That is connected to the. To the different like Hatch and the Bishop agent, all of those types of agents. It would ping this workflow to go and look in our vector store and bring back the response to those agents. So again, there's like, there's five different workflows just with. With all these different agents and things running underneath the hood that we didn't even necessarily have to come up with that completely. We worked with Claude code to help think through and design the system and actually get it put together on our. Behalf and get it going.  \
Them: Yeah. And when you say vector store, do you want to explain a little bit about that?  \
Me: Yeah. Okay?  \
Them: Oh, by the way, sorry, sorry, Tyler, before you answer the question, we are going to go a little over.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: You will know this. Marie knows this about us. We always go over. But there will be a recording if you have to drop on everything like that. We just want to make sure that you guys get everything that you need from us, okay? And we're happy to go over and it's important for you guys to. Understand. Not just the magic show. But how it's done. Why? Why the magic show works. What is actually happening behind the scenes? So don't worry. If you have to drop, we'll still make sure that you guys get everything that you need.  \
Me: Yeah. So we, like, we just really wanted to do this overview and get the onboarding, and then also remember, we're going to have that Async loom that we'll send back as well. Okay, so this human in the loop system, this is kind of like the production email flows, right? Like, all the different components of that. We're going to go through here in a minute. How the heck do we even teach AI to sound like us? Like, how the heck would we even go about doing that? Well, we have something called the. The Echo Agent. That is a brand voice mirror is like how SAR likes to describe it. And what we're going to do. Part of our homework for this week is we're going to create what we call a mega dock, where you're going to get examples of your communication style. This could be transcripts, this could be emails, all, all sorts of different things. And we're going to come back in here and chuck it into this workflow, it's going to do a full linguistic analysis. So if we, if we zoom in on this a little bit more, there's a lot of things that are happening, like getting the data sorted and ready to. Then in parallel, like, all firing at the same time. Each of these are individual AI agent calls that are doing very specific analysis of how it is that you communicate. So that we can take that and use the output of this. To both add into our. Our business second brain. So that the AI agent Sugar knows how to sound like me. If I wanted to. And it's going to give me a piece of xml, so a piece of system instructions for the system prompt for the agent to go in and update and personalize the sugar agent again, so it knows in the system prompt and in the knowledge base. How it needs to emulate how we sound. So instead of it.  \
Them: And when we say. Sorry. When it's. When we say xml, like, you don't have to know about coding or whatever. All it is is a snippet with words in it, like this, this copy and paste thing. That you'll do will generate a text and you will copy and paste it and put it in your agent. So that's what we mean by that. In case you were like, what the heck is that, xml? And why do I need to know that?  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So we'll. We'll come back to this again here in a minute, but I just wanted to show this because we're going to be working on this. Today to create your analyses and the snippets so that you all can know how to personalize your sugar agent to sound more like you. And then if we come back over here, the last little section is that AI Second Brain system. So we're going to be using the very new and also, like, exciting, like Gemini file search. So when we teach this in our own classes, we teach this in a product called Cassidy AI And Cassidy makes a lot of this stuff. Really simple, especially like setting up your own, like second brain or vector database and N8N it's not quite as easy. Traditionally, we would have used something like a tool called pine cone or supabase or something like that. And that is a blocker for a lot of folks, because it can be a challenge to get that set up and maintain it. Google Gemini came out with their version of this that is extremely accessible. And it's really cheap. So I won't go into, like, all of the. The information on that. Like, you guys can go and research that more, and there's even some information. In the GitHub repo that you're going to get about this, that you can chat with your cloud code agent about to learn more about this. But we need to set up all of the infrastructure that will allow us to go through and upload those brand voice analyses, upload the FAQs or the menu or, or website information or all this sort of stuff about Hattie B's into that, that system so that the agents can access it. And all of these workflows that you see in this section of N8N are basically all of that piping to make that happen and keep it up to date.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: And the way this. Go ahead. Sorry.  \
Them: So sorry. I thought you were. You were pausing so you can go.  \
Me: Yeah. So, like, in the way this will work once we all. We get it all. The way set up is you're going to have two options. There's going to be a We can set up a Google Drive hot folder.  \
Them: It's okay.  \
Me: So that there's a workflow in here that watches this. So anytime you drop a document or a PDF or something like that into that folder, it will automatically go and add it into the Gemini file search and store for you. That's one way. The other way, and this is where, like, It's. It's interesting that we can do this. But this right here is a Vibe coded UI UX that we've built out. That makes this really easy, because even though Google made this process really simple, It seemed like they kind of like half baked some of this stuff because they forgot to build a front end. Because to use this, you have to use. You have to kind of be a little bit of a developer to go and do it. So instead, we made this website right here that you all have. And we have the process of how we did it. It's not very hard. That when we come in here and we upload a file like this, I'm just going to, like, grab a PDF, let's say. It's going to then send that over and add it to our vector store. So you can see it just added this to my documents on the Gemini file base right here. It is recorded in here. It shows it if it's active or archived or deleted. You can come in here and actually delete it and. If I delete it, it will go and delete it for me. There's an entire activity log that it keeps. All of this is running. And Will, you will run this locally on your own computer, so it's completely secure. It's very easy to use, and you don't have to worry about deploying this to, you know, a web host or something like that. All that we're going to need is a Gemini API key, which we'll show how to do that and walk through on getting the stack set up, which Claude code will help you do.  \
Them: Yeah, and there's a bunch of people asking about Cassidy is another agent. No, it's not another agent in our workflow. It's just a tool that we teach on a platform that we teach on. So don't confuse it. We just mentioned it. It's not part of. It's not. A new agent that you need to know about. And I see a whole bunch of questions, guys. I also want to make sure that we get through the, like, the actual pudding everything together. And we will stay on to answer your questions, so don't worry. Even though it doesn't look like I'm paying attention, I am. I just want to make sure that we're progressing as well.  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Cassidy is just like. It's another platform. It's not quite like N8N, but they have crossover. And, like, we're having to build a lot of this stuff because. Because we're using N8N. That means you have to build some of your own infrastructure, and that's what's happening here? Okay, so let's switch back over to this slide deck over here for just a second, and we can kind of get back onto the presentation track. And let's switch gears here for a minute. So do you want to pick up.  \
Them: Y. Eah. So hopefully what you're, you know, you've witnessing is we're entering a world where instead of being in execution mode, so instead of being the person that goes, okay, I've got to, like, figure out how I connect this node and drag and drop that node, and is this, like, connection here? Working to that kind of connection and all the things, right? You're able to be an orchestrator, so you're going from execution as a doer. To more like the architect that designs what needs to be done. Okay, so that's like the world that we're. We're heading into, because so far in AI, it's all been all about this new tools dropped and this, like, learn this one, this tool today and that tool tomorrow, and it's. Like very, very disorienting. And now the world that we're getting into. With the ability to, like, just speak things into existence. Is like, how do you know what good looks like? And how do you design? How do you be. Be the architect, the mind behind that, and the AI does the execution? All right. We can move on to the next slide. Okay. So do you want to talk about how it all connects? Because we are, like, all of that is amazing. And you, we need to get you there. Okay. So. And there's a process which is what we're going to go into next. But do you want to really quickly go through that how it all.  \
Me: Yeah, exactly. Even I was, like, reading Miguel's comment in there. It was pretty funny, dude. I fully understand, like, seeing all of these systems and workflows and agents and the overhead of setting that up and keeping it up to date. That's why, like, yes, if you had to do it in the old way, that would be really difficult to do, especially as like a one person shop. Now, not so much, because you have a whole host of. We'll call them Workshop agents. That are going to help you actually set up and manage all of this stuff. So the process of what you're going to see happen is that we are going to describe our intent. Into. We're going to be using Claude code in a tool called VS Code. And we're going to describe that, and then Claude Code is going to help us build all of this out and then deploy it, set up all the infrastructure, deploy it, test it, QA to even help us monitor it. As we keep going. So that once we get this in place, I mean, it's very meta here, we're using AI to help build AI, but that's really where we are right now in this state of things. And it works extremely well, which is amazing. And then what happens? Like, what we saw before is, like, then we're building out that N8N cloud engine, but there's some setup involved. And then the process. We'll touch on this a little bit here, the methods that we use both for, like, engineering mindset and improvement. This is stuff that we'll touch on now, but just know that it's like, baked into the infrastructure in the what you all will be cloning down here in a minute.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: So that Claude code works from these methodologies on your behalf.  \
Them: Yeah. So we baked it in, essentially, our whole, like, methodology behind how we do this so you guys don't have to work about it. And I hear a few people in the chat are feeling, like, overwhelmed. Like. Like, the reason why we're taking through all of this is because we want you to be smarter through this process, right? Like, we want you to understand what's going on. But you do not have to be doing all the things that is, like, the point of us, like, talking you through this. So just trust the process and, like, follow through the step by steps and everything that we're going to give you. And it is just like it is a mental leap because it is a different way of working, for sure. Well, like, I want to acknowledge that, but if you, like, push yourself beyond that, if you trust the process, You will be amazed at what you could do. Like you will be amazed at the possibilities.  \
Me: You got it.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Okay?  \
Them: All right, we'll go into. This. Yeah. We're going to go into this. Set the setup now. And again, like, I want to also say that some of you have started the setup. Some of you haven't. That's totally okay. We're going to go through it. And we're going to have a loom video we sent afterwards because this is live, you know, that is more of a step by step, so you can follow that. So wherever you're coming from, it's okay. We're not going to, like, this is going to be a little bit faster, but we are going to make sure that we give you more of a, like, you know, logical way of following this through after the class, because there's a lot happening right now.  \
Me: Yeah, you got it. And also, like, someone asked about the toast method. We'll talk about that really quickly. This is, like an adapted version of how it has it written out here on this screen for this set and setting, but basically it's a recursive improvement methodology. So totally overwhelming. Sucking tequila. I love it. No, so it's take your output, observe and determine, like, what's working well, what's falling short. You're going to analyze the outcome and come up with ideas, then you're going to stick it back in the oven. So, like, like, you're going to hypothesize, like, what is an update or a change that I can make? Put that back into the system and test it again. So it's like this recursive loop. And the very short story behind that is like, hopefully this will help land this and make sense in your brain and it's a. A dad's story for you or. Yeah. There was some human that figured out that, hey, we could grow wheat, and then we could cut this down and pound it with a mortar and pestle, and then add water to it, throw it in the fire and make bread. And like, you would think that would be good enough. And stop there. I think we can all agree that bread's amazing. And then some other person came along, was like, hey, I think I could take this to the next level. Or let me try this new technique. And they took that bread and they threw it back in the fire, and then we got toast. And it's this whole idea of continuous improvement and this feedback loop that you have in the process that we embody and that is baked into these systems. That it's also alluding to a technique called the meta prompting. So there's a. There's a word that you all can start throwing around in your friend circles too. And you'll sound much more like tech bro. AI Bro. But it's like using these techniques help improve the system by looking at your output. Running evaluations on it, coming up with hypotheses of what it is that you could go in and make improvements on. Go test those again. Like, we're very scientific about that of, like, running isolated tests on it and then running the test again. So that's. That's kind of the lapse there. Okay?  \
Them: Okay, so this is the hardest part is today.  \
Me: Yeah.  \
Them: Like, we want to be honest about that, because there are new kind of things that you need to get set up, and your brain is going to be stretched and you're going to be wondering, like, if you're doing the right thing, if you're looking at the right thing. But, like, trust the process. Because once you get over that hump like this, if all sorts of possibilities will be open for you and you will become like you will be operating in a different way. And I want to call that out because someone said, you know, you have a great style of teaching. We always say to our students, we're here for both the mindset as well as the learning, because this is a mindset change. This is like you're changing habits. You're changing the way that your brain is wired essentially to work in this new way. But if we can get you there. And. Yeah, and then. And then you let us know, you know, whether. Whether it was worth it or not, so. Okay, Tyler, I think it's time to go in the.  \
Me: Yeah. So. Okay, let's talk about this, and then I'll go back into. Actually, like, we're gonna go build this and do the walkthrough of how you actually. I'll do this. So there are the tools of what we're building to in production, which is what we showed y'all. Here a little bit earlier. Of all the different agents and those Nadine workflows, and these are the tools that are gonna help us make all that happen. So some prerequisites of what you're want to have and try and follow along and either do today or do after class. Even if you want to do this, like, work on it to Friday and come back with questions, we're gonna help you through all this. Vs code is what's called a coding ide. It's basically just an app. It's 100% free. It's from Microsoft. And it's in fun fact, this is what if you've heard of the tool called Cursor or Windsurf or anti gravity or some of like similar type tools. All of them are forks or clones. Of vs code. That those companies have built on top of and customize them because it's open sourced now. So that's the tool that we're gonna go set up and run here in a minute. Claude Code is going to be the coding agent that we use within VS Code. And it's a really simple setup here. In a minute, I'll show you that they have an extension that makes this easy. I'm telling you all, if you have not used Claude code or codex, which is OpenAI's version, or something else like that, your mind is about to be blown here in a minute. You need to have an innate in cloud account and all of this is going to be in a PDF in the repo. That you all can follow along in yet another resource to do this, like, step by step, in case you get lost and you're more of like, I want to follow written instructions kind of person. We got you covered with that in there also. So you're going to need the innate in cloud. They do offer a free version, I think, for like free trial for like 14 days or something like that. Or if you just pay for it for one month, if you don't already have it. I think it would be a good investment in this class. But even the trial would be enough to get us across, to get this built. We're going to need to go and get some API keys set up as well. So we're going to need to set up our Google Gemini key. You could think of this as, like, our password. To be able to use Google's file store and their models. And then we're going to go ahead and pull down the repo or repository, what's called cloning it down into VS code. So basically what that's going to do is take that from the cloud and download it onto your local computer so that you can work on it there. And it's like, disconnected from the cloud version. Okay? Now let's switch. And I'm going to stop this screen share and switch screens here, y'all. Where is my. I've got too many windows open here. There we go. All right, so let's go over here to. This screen now. And I'm going to close this out. So let me move this zoom over here and move this so I can see on this window. All right, can everybody see or. Sorry, can you tell me, can you see VS code now, or can someone just, like, drop it in the chat? I don't want to make sure. That zooms. Keeping up with me here? Sweet. Yes. All right, cool. So this is vs code. Like, we can answer questions on this a little bit more. I want to kind of, like, get past that right now. And already over here, this is. I've clicked on this explorer, and this has got our. Our files in here. So the very first step is you're going to want to navigate. You could either, like, Google or Perplexity or we have it in the PDF guide. If you happen to have that pulled up and you can go and download VS code and install that on your machine, that's going to be step one. Step two, when you get in here, is going to be going right here to these little boxes on the left hand side, and it's called extensions. This is what makes this very easy to install Claude code, or Codex or whatever it is that you want to run with. Everything that we're going to be teaching to in class again because we had to pick a tech stack. We're going to be doing this all on Claude code. You could definitely do the same process using codecs and chat GPT with chat GPT projects. We're going to be using Claude code and Claude projects on the desktop to work together. And in here to go find that all you have to do is come into the extensions because it won't be installed yet for you. And search Claude code. That's like a little marketplace in here of apps that can be installed within VS code. And you'll see that it has a blue check mark by and it says Anthropic. That's the company that makes it. You want to make sure that you are getting the exact right extension. When you hit install, it'll have the blue install button like next to it. I've already done it, so it doesn't have that here for me, but you're going to click Install and it will walk you through that process. And I'm going to do this from scratch, like Sara and I will have this in the Async video so you see it completely from zero, what this looks like. What happens next is once Claude code goes to the install process, it's going to ask you to basically log into your cloud account. All you need to have is at least like a $20 a month account. Even if you just buy it for this one month to learn this, that will give you access to Claude. Code and claw desktop. We are platform and tool agnostic. That's what we teach. But everybody's got a favorite kid, and Claude Code is mine. Like, I love it. This is, like, one of my favorite tools, and it proves always to be, like, one of the best, if not the best. That's like a Chevy vs. Ford type argument, though. So we would have had VS code installed. Then we come in here and install the Claude code extension. Now's where the magic starts happening. Like now we're able to see. Once you do that and you walk through that process, you'll see this little icon start to show up right here within VS code. So this little orange icon is the Claude code icon. And if you click on that, it opens up this little chat menu. So this looks like way less intimidating, right? This just looks like chat, GPT or Claude in here. And then you also, if you installed Codex, that's what this is too. You see this little icon, you can click on it, and codex, which is OpenAI's version, pops up over here. If you want to install that and play around with that as well. If you have a chat GPT account. Then you're able to, like, come in and use that. Like, on top of it, like, that subscription covers it, basically. Once you're in Claude code and you're in a completely fresh account. Let me show you what you can do. So if I come in here. Let's go. New window. And I'm going to open up Claude code. And I'm just. So this is what it might look like. You don't have any files loaded yet? Like, so there's no folders added in. You just have Claude code installed. And we're just going to come and talk to Claude and have it help us. And this is all in the PDF, right? We're going to need to have the GitHub CLI Claude, if you don't already have that installed. And I need you to look up, research and find any and all the tools and even use this PDF that I'm providing you so that I can now clone down my GitHub repo that I'm including in this link below, and I'm going to paste that in now. I want you to clone that down so I have a local version of that on my computer to start working in, please. All right, so I literally talked to AI agents. So if you all see me doing this, I'm using a. I know. We'll get asked. I use a tool on my local computer called MacWhisper. It is a Mac only program. I'm sorry all. There are other options out there that work on PC as well like Aqua Voice or things like that. It transcribes what I say. As fast as you saw it. It uses a completely free LLM running on my own Mac studio here at home to do that work, and I just had to buy the app once and now I have free transcription forever that just runs on my machine and that's how I interact with these systems. Now anyone who knows me or has been in class or has hung around me for two seconds, knows that my job description now should be something like, I talked with a funny accent to robots. That's literally what I do. I audibly talk to them. So I want to normalize this, because you could talk way faster and just you don't have to necessarily type it out. Then the other thing that you're going to need here is let me go grab the repo URL. So this is the repo URL. I'll drop this into the chat just so everyone has it. It's also going to be in the PDF onboarding guide. All the things. And if I come back over here to my VS code where I just told it what I wanted to do, I'm just pasting in this GitHub repo as well. And basically what I'm telling it, I already have this stuff installed, and Claude's probably going to recognize this and come back and tell me this. For Claude to go and take actions on my behalf, it needs to have this GitHub tool is what it is. And the GitHub tool allows it to go and look online at GitHub or into my own account on GitHub, which is basically like where our repositories are synced to think of it as kind of like a Google Drive location for coding is the best way to maybe explain it. The Google or the GitHub CLI tool helps it go and actually go get that stuff. So if you don't have that, it would go and pull that now for you and install it and walk you through that, which we have documented. And then now it's going to go and clone is what it's called. But basically pull down this repository that we have built out and shared with you all. And you'll see this in cloud code. Same thing in codecs. Because we don't want the agents to just go out and start taking action on our behalf. Without our oversight. Right. It will come back and ask you these things, like, do you want it to go and run a bash command? A bash command to try and detect. Bro, that is. Think of it as it's going to go run a snippet of code to go execute on a task for you. You can either tell it yes and it will dislike you're approving this one time you can hit yes and don't ask again so it will quit asking you for this particular kind of bash command for this thread. Or you can tell it no if you don't want it to do it or you can just come down here and type in and tell it something completely different. Instead, I'm just going to go ahead and hit yes and don't ask again. So it comes and pulls all this down.  \
Them: And for those people in the chat that feel lost, It's totally fine. Like you're. We're going to actually send a loom and step by step instructions because I know some people have to drop as well. So don't worry. Just try to follow along. We will make sure that we have you guys covered, okay? We have to go fast because it's live. But there will be step by steps.  \
Me: Yep. And if you look at this, Like Claude went and copied it, downloaded this repository for us. So all of these files. And all that looks like if we come over here and. Sorry, let me minimize this other screen right here is. If we come over here and look at it, all it is is like a folder. That has a bunch of files in it. That's literally all this thing did is went and downloaded a bunch of files onto our local machine for us. And it's coming back. And even it recognizes. Hey, I see a bunch of documentation in here, including onboarding and a readme and a setup and all this kind of stuff. Do you want me to go ahead and get this loaded and start the onboarding process? We're going to tell it. Yes. And this is part of, like, if you can get to this stage, if you can get to this H, where you have VS code installed and Claude code installed, we have this thing built so that it kind of takes the wheel for you. And you don't have to know or be overwhelmed with. Holy crap. What is all this, like, code looking stuff happening in the background? It's setting it all up for you. On your behalf without you having to necessarily know how to do that manually. So I'm going to go back and tell it again. Yes. Claude, I would like you to go ahead and run and explore this repo thoroughly, please. And then run any onboarding or setup processes that need to be done, please. Thank you. All right, so again, I'm talking to my little genie in a bottle right here that can go do all this stuff for me, which is amazing. And if you've never seen this, the clog code Agent. Is one of the most agentic experiences that you're going to be able to get on the market today. And it's also very good at things beyond just coding, which that's something we could get into maybe in a Friday session. But it's amazing at what this thing is able to do in here and start doing multiple different things at scale on your behalf. So right here, because it's going to do stuff fast for us, right? Right here, it just asks me, hey, is it okay to run that command? To go and explore? The repo means that it sends out a bunch of little sub agents. To go and look through all of the information that it just downloaded, so it understands it, it pulls it into its context window, and then it can start executing on that. So I approve that. And then what happened is it went and read the readme files, the onboarding file, the setup files that have instructions for your cloud. Code to go and set up all this stuff on your behalf. Which is what it's doing. So, because I've already done this, it recognizes that I have a duplicate in here. And so I'm going to tell it it's asking to remove the duplicate directory. Yours wouldn't say that because you wouldn't have downloaded it yet. But I'm just going to go ahead. This is how smart it is. It's recognized that and I'm having it going to replace my existing one right now. For yours, it would just say, like, hey, I've got this ready. Where do you want me to move this? On your computer. So it stores it in the correct spot. It even knows how to set that up. And we'll go move all these files around for you. And now it's done. And if you really want to look at how this thing is working, Some of the most interesting stuff is it sets itself up these little to do lists and then it has these thinking traces right here. So if you expand those out, you can see even its internal thought processes that it's doing along the way.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: And then it's reported back and telling me what we got. So, setup complete. Like, here's the repository location. So it put it into a folder for me on my local computer, moved it from my desktop into a GitHub folder. It labeled it the MindValley AI mastery student folder for the repo. It's updated it to the latest one. It's telling me the structure and what all's in here. And what we're building per the course, because it knows what it is that we're working towards. It knows that we're building a knowledge base, the expert agent, email processor, the whole thing. And so it says the next steps that it needs to do from the onboarding process is to run a setup script that's passed, and it's telling me what it's done and what it has left to do in here. And so we just need to read through this and talk to Claude, and it'll help us onboard the rest of our workshop tools that we all are going to need here. So let's see here. Mine is telling me the setup script. Pass. Here's what's remaining. Configure Claud desktop and the project from the docs, which we've done. Test the bridge round trip. Okay, so, required accounts from the setup. And would you like me to help with any of these next steps? I'm going to tell it. Yes. And you can do the same thing. Hey, Claude, I am actually doing this as a demo in the class right now, emulating exactly what the students are doing. And so I would like you to walk me through this step by step and help me make sure that I get fully onboarded, that we don't miss anything. And that you help me get fully set up for class so I can start building and be prepped to do this work, please. Thank you. So you can see I'm just talking to it. Plain language. It's very important to be just, like, clear and descriptive. Honestly, you can't be overly verbose. Like, the more information you give it, the more context that you give it, the better it's going to do. And so it recognizes that we have GitHub done. It needs to know if I have an innate in account. It needs to know if I have my Google account set up. It needs to see if I have a Gmail account set up Slack.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Claude or ChatGPT Open Router VS Code and Cloud code and it's already put checkmarks by some of these things for me. And then right here, it's like even set up its own internal to do list that it's going to keep walking through as it gets me through this process, which is kind of amazing. All right, so step one and two are done. Step three is going to be configure cloud desktop. Let's talk about this for a minute. As a part of using agents to build agents here, like with these tools. Without going too far into the weeds. By using the Claude code agent in Vs Code. We can do so much. Like it has the ability to control your computer, move files around like what it just did. It can go out on the Internet and research. It can spin up multiple different sub agents to do things on our behalf. It's extremely powerful tool. What it does not have is it does not like out of the box have a vector store connected to it. So the other thing that we're going to do is set up Claude Desktop, and they don't natively talk to each other. So if I set up a project in cloud desktop and I do work over there, and it's maybe even connected and set, up to this, our repository that we have for this project. If I talk to Claude Desktop and I talk to Claude code, those are like two siloed conversations, two strangers passing in the night kind of thing. Whereas we have built what we call a bridge system that allows you to talk to Claude Desktop and the cloud code, to be able to use both of those tools for different benefits. And you can even ask cloud code to explain to you how and why it works and why we would do this and all these sorts of things. But the short answer here. Is that if we come over here? Let me get clock desktop open back up. And we're in cloud desktop, and we go to our project over here. Once we have this installed. And you would go new project. Like Claude's going to walk me through all this. I'm going to hit new project. And let me move some windows around. There we go. And we're going to call this project AI Masteries. And you could call it whatever you want, right? So I'm going to go AI Mastery. I'm going to put this in here. I'm going to hit Create Project. So what happens now? This tool is so amazing in itself now that we have a project and we have memory enabled. Every conversation we have within this project is accessible to Claude. It can go and look at a memory and all the past conversations if it ever needs to. Because when you, if you've ever used a tool like this or chat gbt, you know that you might eventually hit the end of the thread where you hit the context window, and you have to start a new conversation. And that's really frustrating if you didn't get done and it's like, oh, shit, I need to. I need to tell this new agent what I was doing. Well, now, this way that this claw desktop agent works, it can go and look at past conversations. To figure that out. So that's one benefit. The other benefit is this right here, the file section. This is like a miniature vector store, a miniature knowledge base. That is a vector store. And the reason this is different than the way that claude code works. When claude code goes and pulls some of these files or looks through the information, it will go and actually pull the whole file down and look at it. If we did that over here in Claude Desktop, it does what's called a semantic search. Which the way that those two things operate are completely differently, and there's benefits to both. But that's why we're using the file store here as well. So Claude is going to walk us through getting this set up the rest of the way. Let me see. It was this window right here. So it told me to name it. AI Mastery. Add custom instructions. Here's the content to paste. It's saying copy everything below the custom instructions. And it's telling me where the file is on my local computer. Here's something else you can do. Like, if you. If it ever tells you, like, hey, like, go get the instructions to paste in the clogged desktop or do this, like, you can go find it in this location. If you don't want to go hunting for it, you don't have to anymore. Just tell Claude code. Hey, I'm feeling extra lazy today. Can you just go get those custom instructions for me and then bring them back to me and tell me what I need to do with them, please? Thank you.  \
Them: Tyler, while this is happening, I just want to make sure that we don't miss on a couple questions. I think if I'm reading correctly, it's to ask with, like, the Claude code. Like, I think it's to do with a subscription. I lost it already. I was like, I don't want. To lose that one. I think what to do with, like, the cost of it with claw. If you have Clawd and code requires a minimum Pro account on Claude, can you confirm it didn't work with a free version until I upgraded to the paid version. And then I had another quest question that was. Sorry. I'll find it. While you answer that,  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So I do believe that Anthropic requires a minimum of a $20 account to be able to use all these right now. If you have never used Claude before, and especially never use cloud code, it's the best $20 you can spend in AI right now. In my opinion, it is.  \
Them: So basically. Sorry, the question. The other question was like, is that the cloud code going to take the credits from my Claude account, essentially, because it runs out pretty quickly, is what they're saying.  \
Me: Yeah. No, they're different. So the bucket of conversations that you have with Claude Code is different from the bucket of conversations that you have? In claude desktop. And you could start at the $20 a month plan, then they can scale up from there. It's basically like how much you're going to use the tool. Beyond that. I personally have a $200 a month plan on Claude is what I pay for. And I would pay that, like, five times over every single month because of what it enables me to do even beyond what we're going to talk about and the scope of this course. And maybe that's something we can get into on a Friday session or in Q and A or something. But you can do the course with the $20 plan. But even if you find yourself scaling and it's like, Jesus, is it really worth spending $200 a month for this? If you figure out how to use it like what we're teaching you. 100% and then some.  \
Them: Okay?  \
Me: Okay, so now I was lazy. I asked Claude to go get me the instructions and bring them back to me because I didn't want to go find them on my computer. It went and pulled that file. And now gave it back to me, and it's telling me exactly what to do with it. Like, to the T. So it's saying go to cloud desktop in the app, not the browser. That's an important distinction. You need to have the cloud desktop app downloaded. You're going to go to the folder icon and create the AI Mastery. We already did that. And then we're going to click the add custom instructions and paste this in. Cool. So if I go, Here it is, right here. Here's my AI Mastery project on the cloud desktop app. I'm going to go into right here. The instructions section is what it's talking about. Hit plus. And now I'm going to just paste in the instructions that Claude Code gave back to me. I'm going to hit save instructions. This is like a system prompt or system instructions for this project now. So if you all are familiar with that, what that is, which I'm sure that you do, if you're in this class. That's what we've just pasted in here. Okay, so now Claude better understands how to make this work. The other thing that you can do in here, and Claude will tell me this, but I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun on some of it. Is there's going to be some files you can add in here. And there's also you can hit plus on this. And connect your GitHub account. So if I wanted to come in here and go GitHub. And go look for this repo for me. And pull this down in here. I could come in here and click this. And now it will sync that repository into the file store over here in Clock Desktop. So it can see it as well. So it has, like, context of what are we doing. Over here in Claude code, like they're syncing back and forth in that way from GitHub also.  \
Them: Kind of like sharing your Google Drive with Claude kind of thing. It's the same kind of idea.  \
Me: You got it.  \
Them: So, like, we are at 130 now, which is our time, and we're like, in the setup version, we are going to go over, like I said, into now, the project once we're. We've done with the setup. And I know that you guys have to draw up, there will be the recording. We will be sending this step by steps and everything. This is the hardest part, right? Like, once you get your yourself set up and all of that, the other things that are going to come from that is going to be. You're going to be like, okay. Like, it's. It's not going to be as, like, mentally, you know, you've got a thousand tabs on your. In your mind kind of thing.  \
Me: Yep. So I'm just going to try and get this to the next few parts in here. And I'm going to be as quickly as we can. And if you hear someone talking in the background, that's literally Claude code talking to me. It just said, all done.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: Because once you learn how to do this, I have multiple tabs of it's called clotting of cloud code open, doing multiple different things at the same time. And if I don't have this custom thing that surprise, surprise, Claude code built for me and installed. It has a voice capability now, so it will ping me audibly when it finishes something. So if you ever hear something in the background and it sounds like my computer is talking, It's because it is. Okay, so it went ahead and checked off. It was making sure that Claude code is working. It's like, well, you're doing this now, so good. We're good to check that off the list. Now it's trying to build the bridge and test that up. So this test the workflow you'll use in the course of give AI task. AI executes it. You review the results and let me read the sample task and execute on it for you. So how we can use this bridge. Is if we're over here in the Claude desktop app and we're talking and brainstorming with it and trying to think about what are some tasks that we need to have done that we want to send into cloud code to have it start executing on. So think of this as kind of like, Kind of like one of our project management kind of hubs right here. And then we want Claude Code to be the executor of the tasks that we set up. This bridge system helps do that, so it will write out all the spec documentation. Sync it to GitHub and then now Claude code can see it. And this is building that two way bridge so that Claude code can talk to desktop and vice versa. In here. This is really cool stuff. All right, so it's telling me that it's red. What it needs to do. It's going to create three simple FAQs for the knowledge base. Quick question for the demo, what business should I use for the examples? I'm just going to do Hattie B's, okay? All right. Thank you. Claude, I want you just to go ahead and let's get this bridge set up quickly just to test it and verify that it works. And you can just do this for one simple task, just to verify it works. And we can just use Hattie B's hot chicken for now, please. Thank you. Please walk me through this process, because I'm a bit in out of my depth right now, and I'm trusting you and trusting the process, like tolerance. Sara said. So literally you can talk to it. And if you want it to explain things to you in a certain way, or take on a Persona or break it down in bullet points like whatever you prefer, just literally tell it that, and it'll adjust for you. So it's even giving us the mindset coaching here. Like, you're doing great. Trust the process. The bridge test is what we're trying to prove. The concept is we give AI task. AI does the work, we review its output, and it helps build everything that we need to in this course and beyond. So now what it's gone and done is it's spun up and written some different files right here. It's committing them into GitHub. And then it is coming back and telling me that it has put this in there.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: There we go. And it's already trying to be proactive and move on to innate in. Can you give me just a message to give back to Claude Desktop to verify that I have this all working properly, please? I'm not sure if I do yet. Okay? And we're going to cover this more in depth in the Loom video of, like, completely end to end. How do you do this? And some things that you might run into along the way, because, as you all can see, this is a lot of stuff to cover in such a short session. So right here, it's got the message for me. I pasted that into the wrong place. Whoops. All right, so copy that. That was my bad. This is where I meant to send it through. Come back over here and edit. I promise I can walk into them at the same time. Let's see. So while this is writing its next message for me here, it's trying to verify that you have an innate in setup, and it's even going to walk you through setting up an innate N MCP tool. Which is secure and we can talk about that more. That's going to allow both Claude Code and Claude Desktop to go and take action for you within N8N so that it can go and edit, update, remove, delete, like all sorts of different things on your behalf.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: So that removes the friction of learning the NAN platform. Because now, Claude, the clauds are our copilot at this in here. Okay, so let's paste this in it. Wrote my little message here. I'm going to come over here. Paste this back into the Claude desktop. Hit save so it resends it through. And let's see if this works. I don't know that it's got it. We have it set up all the way yet, so it might tell me that it's failing. Give me a message to go back to Claude code to help finish setting it up. Or it's already set it up for me, so it just depends. But let the Clauds help you work through this to get it all set up. Right. So. Got it. Here's your project summary. It's Walk me through it. It looks like we're good.  \
Them: So. Tyler, there's a couple questions here about what is the relationship between Claude the copy paste between both Claude's essentially like, what's the relationship? Why are we doing that?  \
Me: Yeah. So I just did that right now to basically get this set up and tested and verify that it works. And I'm playing monkey in the middle right now to paste back and forth. Once it's completely set up and Claude code has installed on your computer, all of the scripts that need to be happening in the background and any the tool that it needs to install, if it needs to have like N8 in or any of that stuff set up. Because. When we did this for Sora the other day as a dry run on one of her computers. She did not have, like, one of the xcode tools installed in her on her computer yet. And Claude recognized that, and it asked her if it wanted to do it, explain why it needed to do it, and then went and did it on her behalf. Because that was a blocker for her to get this whole bridge system set up. So that's why I'm saying right now, when we're helping facilitate the onboarding, we have to kind of go back and forth between Claude desktop and Claude code until it's confirmed that it has everything connected and working in the bridge system. And then once you have that, they will actually switch and. They write to the bridge system in GitHub and talk back and forth to each other in that way. And they might or might not give you a prompt to tell the other agent to, hey, go look. I just sent you a message in the bridge. Go look at it and do your thing.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: Or vice versa. Hey, I just finished doing something in Claude code. Tailclaw desktop. So it's aware of it and gives me next steps or something.  \
Them: Yeah, and, and like, also, like, if you're, while you're setting up and you have these questions, Ilana is going to send the Google Drive link for everyone. So we can answer those for you on Friday as well.  \
Me: Yeah. It's entirely possible to do what we're saying without using this whole bridge system.  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: I've just found that in my own processes that it really adds a lot of value to have this back and forth between the two systems in here also.  \
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah. And for everyone. Yeah. Right now you're setting up the infrastructure for everyone's. Like, what am I doing again? This is this infrastructure.  \
Me: Yeah. We're setting up the AI that will build the AI for us, like in the rest of the homework stuff. For the sake of time, because I know we're running over. If you keep working once you get clog code up and running within VS code. It's going to keep working down this checklist, like what it's doing right here. So it's got the bridge working. It's then going to make sure I have N8 in that's going to ask me some questions about my N8N account so it can get that logged and. Set up in here. It's going to ask me if I've got my Google Gemini API key yet, because we're going to need that to set up the knowledge store and the stacks for that knowledge base set up. It's going to ask me if I've set up open router yet. Open router basically allows me to go and get an API key to use for all of the different LLM models. Without getting rape limited that's an issue. If that we found with our students and our other course that if we were to have you go straight to Anthropic or OpenAI and get API keys from there while you're in class, if you've never done that before. They have like tiers of API and you can get rate limited. So by using open router that unblocks us from that. Like you're not going to get run into limits on that. Anyway, Claude will walk you through this entire process. It's going to get this all set up. Once it is all done, and let's say that you've got it done, or even if you just get to a stopping point, this is a habit that you want to get into is what I'm going to do next. And it's called committing. Committing is tech bro speak in GitHub or in VS code. For uploading the current version of the information that's in my local computer to sync it to the cloud. Because right now it's done all this work just on my local drive. And it's not like in the cloud to save it there as a backup or make it accessible from another machine. And so if you commit frequently, so if you tell Claude to, hey, go upload this and document it, and it will document. It and all this kind of stuff for us. And if you do that frequently, it's like you're creating little save checkpoints. So if you ever do something like, wrong or one of the models does something incorrectly or something, it's able to roll back to a previous checkpoint and fix the mess up if it ever were to occur. So it's kind of like time machine on Apple computers, if you want to think of it in that way. That's kind of what it's creating there. So the way you would do this is Claude knows how to do this and we've already taught it and it's in the repo of how we want it to be done. Hey, Claude. Hey. I'm going to pause right now because we're going to switch gears and teach something else in class. I'm going to come back and finish this setup later. Can you commit this to GitHub? I don't have done that before, so I think this is going to be a new repo. And I want to make sure this is done in a private way. So can you set this up all for me in a private repo on GitHub, please? Thank you. Okay, so now Claude would come back and it's going to what's called commit these changes. It's going to create that repo on our behalf, which is basically like setting up a new project on GitHub and then sync all this back to it. And it makes it private, because there's private and public repos. Like, the student repo that we share with you all is public, so, like. Anyone can go to that repo, see it, pull it down, and work within it. And it's called forking it, like making their own version of it. When I do a private repo, that means just myself and anybody I invite to it, that's the only people that can see it. So it's thought about what it needs to do and then it's coming back and it's telling me, hey, I need to go and push this to the main in GitHub for you and settle this up. And that's what it's going to go do now. Like it pushed it to a private repo. It's telling me that it worked. Cool. It's going to go up its to do list. And now I could go walk away and come back to it later and pick right back up where I started. I could even go in here, open a new fresh cloud code thread and say, hey, go explore my repo to be up to speed and help me pick up where I left off last time. Like you literally just talk to it like a person, and it will help you keep moving the ball forward in here.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: All right.  \
Them: Yeah, okay.  \
Me: I'm going to pause and take a breath, Sara, so we can go back into.  \
Them: Yes. Park And like like we said, we're gonna send the loom. We're gonna, like, make it really clear were lots of questions as well, so we wanna make sure also that, like, when we're gonna send the video that we're sort of covering that as well. So just give us a look a little bit of time to make sure we're hitting all the nails in the right places or whatever they say. But I wanna what we're gonna take a clean break from that because that was the setup. Right? Remember when we first started, the conversation today, we said that we're gonna set up the agent the foundational agent that we're gonna need before we build the entire department next week. So this is where we're going to be going into, like, a clean break. Maybe, like, take a deep breath, Like, do a clear, like, okay. Like, compartmentalize that setup now we're gonna, like, context switch into creating the first agent. Alright. So what we're gonna be talking about is you know, how we talked about retrieval augmented generation? Right? We said when we set up our customer service department, we yes. We want, like, all of the information in the Internet that makes our AI agents really smart, we wanna contextualize the the agents to our business, to, like, the our SOPs, our standard operating procedures, our policies, our asked questions, all of those kind of things. So this is, like, this part that we're gonna go into now. Alright. Tyler, you're driving?  \
Me: Yep. Sorry. There we go.  \
Them: Alright. So why why retrieval augmented generation  \
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Them: Why RAG? We just call it RAG. Okay? So because AI it answers questions from general training data, It doesn't have information about how to be specific policies or their internal docs or their brand voice, like, you know, whatever it's made up with. Okay? So it can set we will send out generic, sometimes wrong, and definitely not in your brand voice. In terms of an output or in terms of a response. So when we build a knowledge knowledge base which is RAG, what we're doing is we're feeding the agents the information that contextualizes it to our business, to our documents, to our FAQs, We're gonna train it on our brand voice and how we want it to sound. We want it to function as if, like, we train this whole big you know, people team, a whole big department on exactly all of these things. Again, we're gonna anthropomorphize AI. When you hire someone to work for you, don't just go, see you later. You give them the FAQs, the policies. You say, hey. This is how we sound like in our customer service department. This is the tone. This is the style. This is, like, know, how we escalate when things get crazy or whatever. So that's what we're gonna be doing with our knowledge We're gonna be context giving the agents the contextual information they know, to do the job the best that they can do. To be optimal in terms of how they respond. So, Tyler, can you go next?  \
Me: Yep. Yep.  \
Them: Okay. So  \
Me: There we go.  \
Them: the concept of the brain versus the library. When you have an AI assistant or an AI agent, right, you you essentially give it access to all of this general  \
Me: The  \
Them: purpose information that it's been trained on. Right? So when you build an agent, remember, the difference between an assistant and an agent is the fact that instead of you, like, getting a customer service email, feeding it into ChatGPT, That doesn't sound like what we do, and then prompting it again and then generating, and you're going through this whole whole process. Alright? That is not the assistant acting with autonomy. We do with agents is that we give them autonomy to reason plan, do multistep planning, and take action or execute on your behalf. We're giving an assistant degrees of agency or autonomy. Right? So we're essentially putting the, with the knowledge base, we are essentially having the agent with all of the context, that has been trained on. And through the librarian, which is a connector tool, we're gonna give it access to the knowledge base. So that is going to be the contextual information, that the agent needs to be able to respond in a way that it has all of the power of a large language model trained on and test contextualized to your business and the way that you will handle things and the way that you sound the brand voice, your, like, voice within it. So that's the difference between the brain and the library. Alright. So we talked about the concepts of the brain and the library. Right? And now we're gonna like, what books do we add to the library? Right? So we wanna be intentional. And, again, for those people who asked right at the beginning, why why don't I just have, like, one agent that does everything? This is one reason why you wanna have multiple agents. Right, that have different levels of specialization. That way you can get like, we like to say, we like to build our agents as, as if they're, like, PhD level savant like abilities in their very narrow domains. Right? So that way, we can get the best out of the best out of our agents and these agents then have very specific jobs that they perform with a lot of depth and they're they're attached brain is attached to the right information. Right? So the QA agent or whatever would have different information than like, the policy or the brand voice agent or the one that does the copywriting because you might want your copywriting to reflect certain copywriting rules or whatever. So different information to different agents. But right now, congratulations because you've just been hired by Hattie Bees. So, but, you know, we live in 2025. We're going on to 2026. Thank you, Haribi, for hiring me. But instead of hiring me to be your customer service representative, I'm gonna create an AI version of myself. So what we're doing here is that we're creating a a customer service agent that works for Hattiebee, but as if you were the customer service agent, but you're not gonna obviously be sending the emails. Right? You're gonna train an AI agent to, like, reflect your brand voice. Right? So in order for us to do that, to have an AI version of yourself, you need three things, which is the knowledge you wanna have, like, what is their menu, their food menu. Right? If someone calls in and and inquires about that, or your policies. So, like, if someone wants to return some food or whatever or they're angry, like, what are your policies, your FAQs? All of that kind of stuff. So you wanna give the agent the agent version of you, the information so you it knows what to say. You wanna give it your sending operating procedures, like, how do we handle refunds? Complaints, edge cases so that it does it the right way according to the policy. So, again, like, if you were hired by Heidi Bs, they would have taken you through training, right, and given you a policy or a employee employee handbook. Think of it that way. That's what we're giving our agent. And then also your voice. So even though in the employee handbook that Hadi B's gave you, right, it says, hey. This is our style. We're not super corporate here. We like to, like, say, hey, sugar, and, like, you know, butter people up or whatever, and we're very casual and southern in our in our style. Right? So that is the Hattie B's brand voice that they want you to meet. They want you to emulate that kind of tone and style. So we need to capture that but we need to capture your voice within that. So you have a very different way. Like, I have a very different brand voice. Than Tyler does.  \
Me: So  \
Them: Ilyana or whoever. Right? We have very distinctive styles. So that's what you're building. You're building an AI version of you that is trained on how to be's information. So if we go to the next slide,  \
Me: Yep. Just, like, two quick just for you there too is that  \
Them: okay.  \
Me: again, Clogcode knows all this stuff. So as you're thinking about doing this for the the project for homework, can guide you through what you need to do, what you need to add it the repo, or what you need to add into the Gemini file sort and all that's sort of stuff. And also, if you're wanting to brainstorm to build it for your own business or use case too, like outside of class, you can use it to help it  \
Them: Come up with it.  \
Me: have you think through what kind of information do you need to have in the knowledge base as  \
Them: Yep.  \
Me: well? Like, if it's not a restaurant and you don't need menus and that nature.  \
Them: Yeah. So we need to add add a couple of things. Books that we need to add to the library is the knowledge, so your AI knows what you know or, you know, what you've the employee handbook, essentially. And the voice, the brand voice analysis, we talked about way earlier on, like, an hour and minutes ago now, around how how you speak so that it's reflected when the agent responds to the customer service workflow It's, you know, giving the right information, contextualize the business in your brand voice. Alright. So echo, we introduced you to you earlier. So echo is the brand voice tool that we use. To go deeper. Right? Some most people say, okay. We're professional yet friendly. Well, that's my brand voice. But what I say, I like to be communicated to or I communicate in a personal yet friendly and concise way. Is completely different to what Tyler means when he says that. AI hasn't been trained on what Sara means when she says that or what Tyler means when he says that. So our echo workflow is is essentially intended to really reflect your very unique tone, style, the cadence of which you say, the type of words that you say. Like, Tyler uses y'all a lot and, like, you know, very like, southern things. Sara might say really corporate jargon sometimes, which so it's intended to really capture that information. So in order for it to understand and to capture that information, give it information for it to analyze. And that could look like three to five really good emails that you feel reflect tone of voice. It could be even a transcript of a Zoom call that you have. Or whatever it is. Right? So you're wanting to collect, like, samples of your own communication style. And then you're gonna feed it into, into the echo workflow, it's going to output a brand voice file for you. Right? So then that will be part of what you use to customize your agent, which is sugar. The expert agent that we are building today. Alright? Tyler's multitasking.  \
Me: Alright. So keep keep up with the chat at the same time. You're good.  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, so  \
Me: So  \
Them: gonna teach AI to sound like like you. Like I said, this is a step by step process. We're gonna create what we call a Megadoc essentially, Gather your best emails, transcripts, content, LinkedIn posts, whatever. You know, whatever you feel represents you. A a variety of things can work quite well. Because it captures your voice kind of, like, from different dimensions. Then you're gonna put it into the echo workflow, that's gonna generate a brand voice analysis off of you. We'll also generate what said is an XML snippet an XML block. It's a block that summarizes like because it's gonna produce a lot if the analysis is really thorough, and I would recommend reading it. It's kinda fun. But then it will it will, like, summarize it into a block. That you will then per you know, copy and paste and update your sugar agent provide you with. And then that is what we'll personalize your agent to sound like you that will be part of the, team members in the agentic workflow that we're gonna add the different team members on today. So Tyler, would you okay. So, yeah, like I said, then that enables us to personalize the sugar agent. So the brain is the knowledge we connect it to maybe, Tyler, you could talk about the stack thing in a bit. The voice, we paste your echo profile so it sounds like you. And the results that you get is an agent that knows not only what to say, like, trained on that knowledge that we've given it, the contextual information, but also how to say it. To sound like you. And so we're gonna open the sugar sugar agent system instructions, add in the brand voice, like, essential summary, the snippet that it provides us, this is the moment that the robot becomes your employee. Right? It becomes, like, train on your business. It becomes sound like you. It becomes your AI version, essentially.  \
Me: And, like, the  \
Them: Alright.  \
Me: the thing to remember at that point too so, like, our work homework time. So let's go  \
Them: Yeah.  \
Me: I guess, like, before we come here, let me stop my screen share, and we'll go back over here until, like,  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Me: how do we do this stuff? Really, the quick version here as quickly as I can make it, So let's go to share. Okay. So just how Sara was describing on how we need to go and do all of this work As you might imagine, we can use Claude code to help us do a lot of this stuff too to speed it up. So even as we're making our Megadoc, as we're trying to pull in information and do this, as we wanna think through updating our sugar agent once we actually have all the the analyses and all of these sorts of things done. Get in the habit of can Claude code do it? Like, most likely. Is what I would tell you. So even what I did, I had transcripts from class and and from, like, lessons that we had shot. And I had, like, examples of writing and things like that saved on my local computer So I literally came in here and told Claude Code that exact thing. Hey. Go and look on my computer and see if you can find some good examples of transcripts of my communication Pull the whole like, transcript and copy it, into my repository here in this project. So then it would take it and add it over here into the repo. So let me, like, open this up really quick. So if I open this, it would take it and add it over here into this repo for me. Then start making the Megadoc. Type process in here. And and assembled it for me. And then it could give it back to me as, a completed file that we're gonna take over into N8N. But even before you can get to the n eight n piece, you're gonna have to have Claude Coat go and like, walk through the rest of the onboarding that we kind of like, skipped ahead on because of time here. And once it's set up in eight in, and it can actually go and do things on behalf for you, it will go and ship these templates that we showed you over here in our n eight n into yours because they're in that repository in GitHub, and Claude knows how to go set all this up for you. So once that's done, this is where you're gonna get into the Echo brand voice tool. It's probably not gonna put it into nice, neat little folders. Like, I did that later because I was just, like, OCD about it, but it will put, like, all the workflows in here and personal section. You're looking for the an Echo Brand Voice Analysis folder is what you're looking for. And or, I mean, in it in workflow rather. You're gonna click on this, This is that that big honking workflow we showed you all earlier where it's doing all these your communication style, linguistic analysis right in here. And what you wanna do and Claude can walk you through this completely, you're going to zoom in to this very first trigger right here because this is just a very simple workflow. And you're gonna click on this, Like, once it has it set up, it it might need to get some API keys from you to finish setup as part of, like, the onboarding. But once you're you're past that, gonna come in here and go to the to this first node. And click on production URL. And, again, if if you're if you're lost and you don't know what to do in here, Claude is your copilot on all of this. It it knows what the secret is. So you grab this URL right here. And you just open a new tab in your website browser. And now we're at something that looks like much easier. Right? This is just an n eight n form that is connected as an like an ingestion form into that workflow. And so you're gonna come in here and you're gonna choose am I doing this for my own personal brand voice? Am I doing it just for the organization at the organization level? Or am I gonna do some sort of combined version here in? Like, you have some options. I would recommend like, we built it this way so y'all could use it beyond the class. We already have the Hattie B stuff done, so you don't need to do the company That's already baked into it. So you're gonna choose personal. You're gonna put in your name. I'm just gonna put in, like, Tyler Fisk here. I don't need to put company name in because, like, I've already already selected personal. Writing samples is where I'm gonna go take my Megadoc and I'm gonna take the entire contents of my Mega Doc and paste that in here. And then company materials, we don't need that because we're not doing the company version. That's just for if you run it outside the class, And then the the QC validation is, like, if you wanted to to save a little bit of time and, like, hardly any money at all, you could bypass the quality control step in that workflow. But I just would select no, which is what's recommended. Okay. Then what we would do, if I come back over here, let me get into the repo that I actually have my my Megadoc in. Bear with me here, y'all. See here. Session one. Wrong one. Let's see. Task. Right here. Brand voice. Okay. So if we look this is a Versus code repository. This is like an internal one for this class. Right? This is where we've done a lot of this development, and it's also where we've, like, tested and and built out all this stuff. So as you begin to build out your repo, you'll see in here it begins adding more files, the bridge is going keep a history of what's been done, and you're gonna fill it up with, like, more and more information over time. Just like you might do in a Google Drive. And this is the Megadoc that assembled for me that I was talking about a minute ago by going and grabbing my transcripts and just like putting it all together me. So you no longer have to go and, like, grab the transcripts, like, literally, you can give it the files or tell it where they're located, or even give it your LinkedIn URL, it can go and look at your LinkedIn and pull down social posts and things like that. To go and ingest that information add it to your repo, and produce this file for you that's the input for this workflow. So I'm gonna copy all of this Megadoc that it's made for me, I'm gonna come back over here to my web browser. Where I had that n eight n form up. And I'm just gonna paste this in. And then I'm gonna scroll up because it might make some little annotations for you. Like, right here, it's telling me, like, end of mega And if you forget to delete it, it's probably not gonna be the end of the world, but I'm just gonna delete it out just in case. So now it's just my transcripts in here. And it's literally taking transcripts and examples of like, my writing and stuff and chucked it into one massive document for me. And I'm gonna hit submit. And what this has done is now it's gonna kick off this workflow over here underneath the hood. So if I come back into my N8N desktop, right here, and I go into the executions section right here, you'll see that it's going to start running. So there's the editor tab and the executions tab. And again, like, I know we're going through this fast, Like, if in doubt, ask Claude Coat, and it will help, like, guide you through the process. And this takes just a minute to run. It should take, like, depending on how much you give it maybe five minutes If it runs more than five minutes, then you can come in here and click stop execution. Because that was happening to me earlier, it got caught in a loop without getting into, like, the weeds on it. But it it, like, for some reason, it kept looping in there, and it I just stopped it, and it had already done all the work. It just wanted to keep, like, reviewing it again. Like, the parsing of it. So if it finishes, it'll show green. And it will show up like this. So like you can come in here see all of the work that's been done. And in NADN, when you're looking in this, these green paths shows the path that the workflow took. There's some different logic of when it might take a different route in here. But I gave it my Megadoc, It ran through all these steps. It fed all of this over into my, Anthropic model. I'm running Haiku 4.5 is the model that's doing all these different analyses right here and these are different types of linguistic analysis of my communication style. And it creates it uses SONNET 4.5 right here in this step to to make that little code block that we need to add it to our sugar agent to personalize that agent to us. So if if this runs to the end like it's supposed to, it should give you back the files in, like, a nice, neat formatted version. It should give it back to you all of the the reports of the analyses, all in, like, a nice succinct way. Give you back a different file that gives you back the XML. And, again, like, so you have both of those you can just take back over into clogged code. If for some reason you have to to kill it and it it, like, it overruns or gets hung up because, like, these things happen. Right? Like, we're talking about tech. I would get used to, like, working in squishy situations, in this industry. Like, You can close this out and you can also just come in and individually, like, click on these nodes right here. That opens up the recording of what happened. Right? And over here, it shows you this is what was the input into this particular step. Here's what all the parameters were around like this, like the LLM and the the the user prompt and system prompt, all that kind of stuff. And over here is the output, like, what it produced out of this step. And an easy way to to copy all this is if you come over here and click on JSON, it has that entire steps output in a nice, neat, easy way to do it. So I could just come and copy this if I needed to. And come back over here into my, like, Claude code and just, like, paste that in and then come down and like, repeat that process. So, like, I would come in and grab, like, the next output make sure I'm on JSON, copy it, and come into to clog code and paste it back in. And you would do that for and I'm you're only having to do this, like, manual copy and paste if it happens to fail. If not, because it could take it a minute to run, once it runs all the way, it should give you all these outputs, like, nice and neat and formatted in five already for you. But just in case it doesn't, like, I'm giving you the backup plan too of, like, you just go in, copy them out, and paste it in, and you're good. And you also need this XML step right here. So this is creating the the that's going to go into the system instructions for the sugar agent. So I'm gonna copy that as well. So let's pretend that I have like, all of these together. I have the files that it produced for me. And I go back over here to Claude code, and I I paste all this in or I attach the file, either or, And to attach a file in here, you'll get used to this. There's this forward slash command right here. So if you hit the forward slash command on your your keyboard, it'll pull this up. Or you can literally just, like, click on this and it also pulls it up. And if you start typing, and just start typing attach, you can see this, and then it just pulls up where you could attach the file if you had it to download it in that way. That's a way that you can upload any sort of an attachment for Claude code to to look at it. Even be able to see it. So if you need to take a screenshot of somewhere that you're stuck, that's a really common way to help get yourself out of a situation. Is screenshot what you're saying and give it back to Claude. It can see what you see then help you move forward from there also. So, again, like, I'm I'm trying to give you some of these, like, meta tips along the way also because, this is a new mentality of how do I use this AI agent like this to help me build the things. It's a new mindset to have to wrap your head around. Hey, Claude. So I have run the brand voice echo workflow, and I haven't copied all of the analyses out yet, but I've grabbed a few of them. And I grabbed the the system instructions I think the XML is is what Tyler and Sarah called it. And I I'm supposed to use that to personalize my sugar agent and I'm supposed to also add these analyses into my Gemini file store. You help me with this process, please? Okay. And so while this is running, it's gonna take just a second. I wanna call something out right here too. I said it in the chat, but I wanna say it here also is that if you hit shift tab, while you're in Versus Code, Like, if I do that, you see how this is changing down here where it switches between plan mode, before edits, and edit automatically? These are different modes that you can put Claude into. You can also click on it, and it will cycle through them too. Ask before edits means that it's gonna come back to you more frequently and ask for your permission to go do things. If I go edit automatically, you're putting it more into YOLO mode, it will go do more things autonomously and check-in with you less frequently. It's not fully autonomous, but it give it takes the the restraints off of it a little bit more. If you switch it into plan mode, plan mode puts the handcuffs on it and says, hey, you can't go edit or update anything, but you can go look and research and formulate your game plan for how it is you're gonna go do this thing that that Tyler just told me to go do or you told us to go do. And then it'll come back and say, hey. Here's my plan. Do you agree with this? If so, like, yes and proceed forward with it. If not, tell it no or tell it how you want it to be different, and it'll go back and come back with a new plan. And then you either approve it or not. But these are different modes that you can use within ClaudeCode that are extremely powerful. So right here, Claude's telling me, hey. I can help you with this. You've got great outputs from an echo work Let me break this down on what I can do on both tasks. What you've collected. We have sentence structure analysis and vocabulary tone analysis, plus my brand voice XML that are used for your sugar agent. Let me create the files for each of these so we can save them properly to your repo so it knows the record it in here so we have it recorded. Let me upload them to your Gemini file store for you. So if you if it you have not set it up yet, it's gonna help you set that up at this point. And let me use the XML to put it into your sugar agent. So it's literally gonna like you just brought up the stuff back over here, and it's gonna go do a lot of the work for you. And I know that it seems like we we've put this up with a little bit of training wheels right now, But once you see how this works, it's literally like learning, oh, crap. Like, Claude can probably help me do this thing. Like, whatever these tasks might be like this. So I just need to ask it and tell it in plain language. And it's more of like this orchestrator. You get to be the the AI boss agent yourself on trying to have it go help you do this work faster. Because if I had to go do all this myself manually, again, it would take a lot of time. So while this is working in the background, I can go drink a coffee or go do something else for a minute or work on something else. Can even open a new Claude code thread and start working on some other part in here that I need to and then they can work completely parallel to each other. It's pretty  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: amazing. Alright. So Claude told me it's all done. It saved all three files into a brand voice folder that it just made right here. And then it also you'll see there, there's just, like, blue number four right here. When you see this, this is showing your your repository structure here locally. And it's showing you how many new files are here local that are different from what you have in the cloud up in GitHub. And so you can when you have it commit this, so, like, this is a signal when you start seeing a lot of number, like a a higher number over here. A signal to have Claude commit and document this for you. So it syncs it back to the GitHub repo in the cloud also. It's like creating a backup. It's even going to proactively try and like, at different intervals, ask you if you want to commit it. Because we've taught it to do that. But it's always good just to build your own habit too of, like, committing frequently also. So you're, like, saving it beyond just your local store in here. Okay. So it's done this. It's also it's using our task system. And it's asking if we want to go ahead and add the Gemini file store It's telling me to go to Google AI Studio. Create a new file, use this. Like, if you already had your n eight n stuff, we have the workflows in n eight n that wire actually do this for it where Claude can help you do this part as well, like, actually adding it over there. And then for the sugar agent. So let me let me have it do the sugar agent, and then I'm gonna show you another way that you can actually add this stuff into the the Gemini file store in a in, like, using the stacks that we showed y'all and built out. Alright, Claude. Thank you so much for all your help. What I want you to do is let's focus on doing number two right now. Just go ahead, and if you can fully customize and personalize my sugar agent with the the brand voice XML and add that into it. And update or edit and add to the instructions any other way that we need to so that agent is fully personalized to me. For this set and setting, I'm also working for Hattie B's. Please go ahead and do that. And then please save that back into my repo too, please. And then once you're done with that, I want you to be sure that you also get into the habit along with me and remind me to constantly keep updating documentation within the repo and committing to GitHub as well and keeping that that all up to date, please. So please go do the sugar agent, and then once you're done with that, go ahead and create the commit. I'm gonna do the Gemini file store using the stacks front end instead of having you do it here in Claude code. Please. Thank you. Okay. So I'm gonna I gave it my little brain dump right here. And instead of me asking before edits, I'm gonna let I'm gonna put it in YOLO a little bit so y'all can see what that looks like. So I'm gonna hit shift tab or click on this until it says edit automatically, and I'm gonna send this through. So now Claude is is still like, Claude is still gonna come back here and check-in with me, but not not as frequently. So it created this little to do list, and it's gonna go off to the races and start working on getting all this set up for me. So while that's happening, let me come over here and show you what this looks like Yep. See, this one got hung up for some reason. This one will kill this execution. Something you all might run into I I think that this is something that's going on with n eight n today or if there I haven't looked online to see if there's an outage or something today, not with them, but just it could be a server store or something that's getting used because even this morning, was like, it's demo day. It's there's always gonna be some sort of, like, fun tech hiccup. And I I was debugging it and looking through it. I'm like, there's nothing wrong on this. And it like, we think it's something that's going on elsewhere that's, like, affecting some of these things, and and I'm not sure I haven't had a chance to fully, like, figure that out yet. Okay. So if I come back over here into NAN, and as part of your onboarding, Claude is gonna help you set up all these Gemini file search in a den workflows right here. Remember, these are like the pipes that that it's gonna put in place so that you can either have a Google Drive folder that you add things that you wanna go into your your library. Either through the Google Drive folder or through the stack UI that we have built out that you'll run locally in your browser. So once Claude has helped you set this up and set up the stacks for you, it, like, it will walk you through it bit by bit. We're gonna have this in the async video too because, again, like, the onboarding to all of this stuff just takes a little bit of time. And once you do, like, you move a lot faster. Once the stacks is built, it's gonna look something like this. It's gonna walk you through and get this all going. It's gonna spin up what's called a local host which basically means that it's like hosting this website on your own so it's not available on the open Internet. And it gives us access to this interface to be able to manually add things into our library is the Gemini file search, through this UI instead. So that's where like, once this is done, it's gonna ask you to add in your API key and put in your n eight n webhook URLs like this. And then you can proceed to go ahead and doing the rest of this work in here. And at that point, literally, like, all you're gonna be doing it it looks it works like you how you might think. You're gonna click on this. You're gonna grab maybe your brand voice analysis. The f o FAQs that you have for Hattie bees, which are in the repo, and you can add to them more if you'd like to. That's something we could talk about maybe on Friday. You wanna upload those so that they're in your personal Gemini file store that are accessible to your agents in NADM you're working on here.  \
Them: All done.  \
Me: That's where you're gonna grab the file, open it, just upload it in here, I think mine's, like, timed out, it's, like, failing right now. But, like, once it's once it's I reconnected it back up, it'll just, like, upload it to Gemini and show up like what it did earlier I was doing that at the beginning of the demo. And again, just like I'm gonna say it, and you're all gonna get tired of starting out saying this, because it's a practice, a habit you need to get into that if you hit blockers, say I did this, Claude code set all this up for me, and then I'm like, oh, crap. I just I did what Tyler said. It's all set up, and then I'm uploading my my doc in here, and it's, like, erroring out. What the heck? How do I fix this? What I could do then is like, try and upload it again And then if it fails, try and get it screenshot it to capture any error or just, like, remember what it said. You can even come into the activity log if it catches some of this stuff and, like, copy this out too or screenshot this. Take this back over into Claude code, and give it back to it and tell it what's going on and tell it what you're doing and telling it, hey. Here's this screenshot so you can see what I'm seeing. Can you help me Either you go fix this and debug it or help me do it. Like, whichever way that you personally wanna do this. I'm talking about y'all wanna do this. If you wanna learn how to debug it yourself, it'll walk you through it. If you'd rather Claude just, like, go fix this freaking thing, like, it'll go do it for you. And then you can come back and get this up and going. So in the same way that it helps with the setup of this stuff, it can help with the debugging and fixing of it as well. Because it's it's AI. It can happen sometimes when you're getting things up and rolling. Okay. Let's come back over here. This I think this is the last thing that we can end on and thank you all for for hanging in there with us. I know that this is, like, a fire hose of information and it's a lot. But what we're teaching y'all, if you can absorb just even parts of this is gonna like, put you up, like, in the 1% of AI right now, especially this clawed code bit right here. Okay. So this went ahead. While we were doing something else. It it added all this information, It created the commit, so it synced it up to GitHub for me. It did the sugar agent and created that and added it. So right here it even made a new section. So it made a prompt section made an agent section. And then it put Tyler's How to Be Sugar. And so now if I were to go and interact with this agent right here, it's gonna sound like Tyler, the Tyler version of sugar. Especially once I get this next week when we show y'all how to use have sugar in N8N and connected to your your library to be able to go and look at the brand voice analysis on top of this too. So, again, we're trying to get all of the pieces in place this week to get going for next week. Alright. I'm gonna take a breath, and we're gonna come  \
Them: Guys, this is a lot, and it's amazing. And we way over time. But, like, hopefully, you guys can see the the what is absolutely possible. Like, when when we actually pull together everything, right, So this is gonna be worth it. I promise you. The most important thing so there's two pieces of homework. Alright? The most important one is that you get set up. Obviously, nothing's gonna happen downstream from that. So if all you could do one fry by Friday is getting set up, that like, that is fine. As you probably can tell, Tyler and I are here to get you guys to the finish line. Like, we mean it. We will stay extra time on Friday, We will get the looms and and the step by steps and everything to you as well We've got a ton of questions. Which just give us some time because we also wanna make sure that we cover a lot of the the things that you ask, as part of what we're gonna send out. So that you guys aren't hanging, but we just had there was just so much going on. So the most important thing is that you get set up will be a separate, like, document step by step and room for that. Will be a separate part two of the homework will be to create your agent and person with the echo, thing that you just saw. And we will create a separate, like,  \
Me: Yep.  \
Them: separate assets for that. So, yeah, I just wanted to say thank you all also because I have to say, like, you guys have kept this energy going right from the beginning, and I'm so proud of you guys because this is a lot. You guys don't know us. Just rocked up here and, like, showed you some stuff, and you guys are following, and you're have such a, like, a growth mindset. Is gonna get you far. The fact that there's, like, almost 300 of you still hanging in there, almost three hours on. Okay? Like, you guys are going to be phenomenal at this stuff, so just trust the process. Give us some time to, like, make sure that we really lock in and get everything set up right for you. And trust yourselves because you can do this, and we've you know, we're here teaching you this because we believe that you can do this.  \
Me: Yeah. I I love it. And we will also the slide deck I'll even give it to Iliana so we can email it. We'll add it. And and add it to the student repost. So we'll we'll update the repo also, like, as you'll see. We'll we'll talk about this even more. Just so if you wanna go see the slide deck along with the recording, you'll have that. The other thing I wanna give a, like, quick shout out to Panda, that I think was the name in here. That was trying to debug. They were setting up Claude code in Versus Code, think is what it was, on their Windows machine and they kept hitting blockers. And in the chat, I was like, hey. Go talk to Claude code. And tell it these few things and see if it can help you fix it. And they report it back when it's, like, check the chat, they're like, yeah. It fixed it. So, like that is the absolute proof that you you can lean on these systems to help you get through this onboarding process that is extremely it's a lot. Like, there's no denying that. But the the good news is too is, like, once you get Versus Code and Claude Code, like, all these parts and pieces, yes, you you're gonna use them in class, but you can also start playing with this stuff extracurricularly too. And, like, these tools don't go away. So you'll have them set up and installed to use on, other things that you want to start tinkering around with. And I guarantee you, once you do this and it clicks, it's addictive. Like, you'll wanna start being like, well, what the heck can I build?  \
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  \
Me: Kinda thing. So yeah,  \
Them: Yeah. And we can't we can't wait to to see what you guys do with it. So thank you for bearing with us. And and, like, you know, we honestly honestly, this felt like normal class time for us. We don't feel like we just walked into a strange, like, place where we don't know anyone. This is what it's actually like for us. So thank you guys for also, like, the energy and the space for us because as you can tell, it's like, really important for for us that you guys get to the finish line, that you guys, like, grow and you see what's possible for you. So, we're so, like, yeah, like, lots of gratitude. Lots and lots of gratitude for for this day. The opportunity. Eliana? Thank you. Just just the gratitude is from us. Thank you so much for so much detail and value in the setup. I thought it was so useful, Tyler, how you did it from a unquote beginner's way when you were speaking to the AI. I think that was so useful and the same the way you explained the reasoning behind it and why you're doing what you're doing in the moment in between. It's gonna be so useful for the students while they watch the replay as well. And actually, Sarah, I saved what you wrote in the chat. And I wanna read it out in case people did not see it. I really think it's important. You wrote, it's normal to feel excited, overwhelmed, a little scared, empowered. This is a new way of working and your brain is being stretched. I completely agree with that. Thank you so much for stretching. Student's mind so much and presenting all of this to us.  \
Me: I love it. We're we're excited, especially, like, all  \
Them: Thank you. Pleasure.  \
Me: season coming up. Y'all are gonna be able to go brag to your family that you're you're all, like, developers now. You're coders and they won't know the difference. I guarantee you.  \
Them: So what I'm gonna do is share the question submission form in the  \
Me: So So  \
Them: now. Of course, you'll have it in under the lesson of today. So if you have any questions, as Sarah and Tyler said, while you're getting the homework done, is today's setup, of course, with the same case study. Submit them there, and Sarah and Tyler will have a look at them. And, of course, I will share with you also the questions that are coming in from the q and a box to both of you so you can have a look of those as well. And that's it. I know we're quite, already quite over time, so thank you to all of you guys for coming in live. Thank you for staying back. You all are amazing. Great work today. Get some rest. Good luck with doing the homework, and I will get Sarah and Tyler's Loom video up on today's lesson. So it's we're gonna be right underneath today's class recording. That's where the Loom video will be. Okay.  \
Me: Alright.  \
Them: Thank you. Thank you.  \
Me: Thanks, y'all. We'll see you soon. Yes. We're gonna work on the Loom and start recording it, here, like, it might be this afternoon or this evening when we send it through because we and I actually have, like, a team meeting with our team here in a little bit. So we'll try and get done before them, but just in case it might be after that. So just a quick timing heads up there. Alright.  \
Them: Thank you so much.  \
Me: Love y'all. See you soon.  \
Them: Thank you.  \
Me: Bye.  \
Them: Bye, everyone. Bye. }
