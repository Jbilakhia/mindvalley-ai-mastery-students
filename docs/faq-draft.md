# MindValley AI Mastery - FAQ Draft

## FAQ: Prerequisites & Requirements

**Q: What do I need to have set up before Session 1?**

A: You'll need several accounts and subscriptions before the first session. Required accounts include: GitHub (free), N8N Cloud with Starter plan ($20-50/month), Google AI Studio for Gemini API (free), a test Gmail account, Slack workspace access, and either Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus ($20/month). You'll also need VS Code with the Claude Code extension installed, and an API key for OpenRouter, Claude API, or OpenAI API ($5-15 total for the course). The total monthly cost is approximately $50-85 during the course. See SETUP.md in the course repository for the complete checklist and detailed setup instructions.

## FAQ: Technical Setup

**Q: I'm not technical - can I still complete the setup process?**

A: Yes! The course is specifically designed for non-technical entrepreneurs. The setup process takes 60-90 minutes and is broken down into simple, step-by-step instructions in the ONBOARDING.md file. You'll use Claude Code (an AI assistant in VS Code) to help you through the technical parts. The setup includes running a verification script (setup.sh), importing pre-built workflows into N8N, and testing your API connections. If you get stuck, there are troubleshooting guides in the docs/ folder, and you can get help during Friday office hours. The key insight is that you're learning to orchestrate AI - the AI does the technical work, you make the strategic decisions.

## FAQ: Course Structure

**Q: What will I actually build in this course?**

A: You'll build a complete AI-powered customer service system that handles emails automatically. The system includes five key components: an Email Filter that pre-screens incoming messages, a Librarian agent that retrieves information from your knowledge base using Gemini File Search, an Expert Agent that crafts responses in your brand voice, a QA Agent that reviews responses for quality, and a Human-in-the-Loop system via Slack that pings you for approval before sending anything. Nothing gets sent to customers without your review. By the end of the course, you'll have a working system that reads customer emails, finds relevant information from your docs, drafts professional responses, and waits for your approval - turning what traditionally takes a developer months to build into something you can orchestrate through conversations with AI.
